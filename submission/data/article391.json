{"content": "On March 6, the Arkansas legislature enacted the toughest abortion law in the nation, banning the procedure after 12 weeks of pregnancy. The accomplishment stood for all of 20 days before North Dakota, with a law Gov. Jack Dalrymple signed on Tuesday, banned abortion at about six weeks. Both laws prohibit abortions once providers can detect a fetal heartbeat, a milestone with no meaning to the federal laws governing abortion. (The Arkansas law requires providers to do so with an abdominal ultrasound, and the North Dakota one by any technology available, including a transvaginal probe, which can detect a heartbeat weeks earlier than an abdominal ultrasound.) The North Dakota law, by requiring that providers try to detect a heartbeat so early, effectively bans abortions for women who might not even realize they are pregnant. In practice, it might make transvaginal ultrasounds mandatory for women seeking abortions early in their pregnancies. But the effects of these laws are not intended to be felt only by women living in Arkansas and North Dakota. The people who support these laws dream that they will provide a legal basis for overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\nMark Gietzen, the head of the group backing a bill just introduced in the Kansas legislature, promised as much to his supporters in an email he sent earlier this week. As the Huffington Post reported, \"Gietzen noted that the bill was designed to appeal to Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, considered the court's swing vote on abortion, to force the court to overturn Roe v. Wade.\" Dalrymple, despite signing the North Dakota law and socking away funds for the expected legal challenge, does not seem confident of this strategy, saying on Tuesday, \u201cAlthough the likelihood of this measure surviving a court challenge remains in question, this bill is nevertheless a legitimate attempt by a state legislature to discover the boundaries of Roe v. Wade.\u201d Thing is, the boundaries of Roe are already settled. \u201cBoth of these laws are just blatantly unconstitutional,\u201d said Gretchen Borchelt, senior counsel for the National Women\u2019s Law Center. The Supreme Court ruled in Roe that states cannot ban abortion before a fetus is viable outside the womb, she said\u2014typically around week 24 of a pregnancy.\n\nBoth laws have other, weedier problems. The court ruled in Roe that states cannot draw a line at a particular gestational age and call it the start of viability. But the Arkansas law does draw a line, at 12 weeks, on the premise that viability ought to be defined as the moment when an ultrasound can detect a heartbeat. Roe permits states to ban abortion after viability, but any prohibitions have to include a health exception, and what physical or psychological conditions constitute a health exception is up to a doctor. The health exceptions in the Arkansas and North Dakota laws are narrowly defined as medical emergencies\u2014cases where there is \u201ca serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function,\u201d as the Arkansas law puts it; the North Dakota law uses similar wording. \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t even pass the laugh test in court,\u201d said Julie Rikelman, the director of litigation for the Center for Reproductive Rights, a legal advocacy group that plans to challenge the Arkansas law along with the ACLU. \u201cIt should not even get to these questions.\u201d\n\nIn fact, women in North Dakota and Arkansas may never have to deal with these restrictions. Talcott Camp, the deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s Reproductive Freedom Project, is fairly confident that by the time the laws are scheduled to take effect\u2014Arkansas\u2019s in mid-July, North Dakota\u2019s on August 1\u2014the courts will have blocked them. For a preliminary injunction, she said, \u201cThe basic formula is, does the law cause irreparable harm, and is your suit likely to succeed on its merits? We are overwhelmingly likely to succeed,\u201d she said. As for irreparable harm, \u201cDepending on the period of time you\u2019re talking about, the literal Constitutional right could not be exercised\u2026. It\u2019s not as though the state could make up for it by, say, giving you money afterwards.\u201d\n\nThere is also not much hope among mainstream anti-abortion advocates, who prefer a legislative strategy that chips away at Roe, that these laws will stand. Paul Linton, who was Americans United for Life\u2019s general counselor for many years, has said that fetal heartbeat measures \u201chave no chance in the courts.\u201d When James Bopp, general counsel to the National Right to Life Committee, spoke to me in July about aggressive laws like these, he worried that they could go all the way to the Supreme Court\u2014where there are not the votes to overturn Roe. \u201cIf one of these measures ever got to the Supreme Court, which is highly unlikely because they are so obviously unconstitutional under Roe v. Wade, it would allow the court to refashion abortion law under, maybe, gender discrimination. Which would mean that all regulations on abortion would be unconstitutional.\u201d He continued, \u201cI don\u2019t know what they are thinking.\u2026 Normal people don\u2019t spend a lot of time banging their head against the wall.\u201d\n\nBut if and when they lose the court fights over these two laws, the anti-abortion movement will still have notched a victory. Relentless lawsuits, Rikelman said, even the patently baseless ones, make constitutionally protected abortion rights appear as though they are up for discussion. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous,\u201d Rikelman said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to go to court every year to restore the right to vote. Women shouldn\u2019t have to rely on legal centers year after year after year to reestablish rights outlined forty years ago.\u201d Currently, five other states\u2014Wyoming, Kansas, Ohio, Kentucky, and Mississippi\u2014are considering fetal heartbeat bills, all of which groups like Rikelman's would have to challenge. A court decision against the North Dakota or Arkansas laws would foretell the fate awaiting those bills, should they become law, but that probably wouldn\u2019t deter legislators in those states from plowing ahead. \u201cThe Supreme Court, let alone a circuit court, has already said several times that laws like these are not constitutional,\u201d Rikelman said. She was citing a string of lower-court decisions that have invalidated or blocked the \u201cfetal pain bills\u201d passed in nine states since 2011, which ban abortion at 20 weeks. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t stopped anyone.\u201d\n\nBut even if these bills are overturned by the courts, they could yet succeed\u2014as cover for less sensational, but nonetheless insidious, abortion bills. Dalrymple, when he signed North Dakota\u2019s fetal heartbeat bill, signed another law mandating that only physicians who have hospital-admitting privileges may perform abortions. That law is likely to shutter North Dakota\u2019s sole abortion clinic, the Red River Women\u2019s Clinic, and it is attracting far less outrage than the heartbeat bill. (A similar law has brought Mississippi\u2019s only abortion clinic to the brink of closure.) \u201cThese two new laws seem so extreme. And they are extreme, and they are dangerous, and they are outrageous. They do take away medical decisions from women, their family, and their doctors,\u201d Camp said. \u201cBut we really ought to see them as part and parcel to the same mission as people who take the incremental approach.\u201d In other words, don\u2019t fear fetal heartbeat laws; fear the lesser-known bills that look reasonable by comparison.
