{"content": "NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. \u2014 Jeb Bush walked into the lion\u2019s den Friday, seeking to quell doubts among conservatives that his views on immigration and education make him unfit for the presidency.\n\nThe former Florida governor told the Conservative Political Action Conference that he is a \u201cpracticing, reform-minded conservative\u201d and reminded the standing-room-only crowd of his experience and achievements in boosting the economy and revamping the way a government operates.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve actually done it,\u201d Bush said.\n\nAt the beginning of his appearance, Bush was interrupted by shouts and a small number of people who walked out in protest. Earlier in the day, the mention of Bush\u2019s name sparked booing by an audience that loudly indicated it preferred Scott Walker, Ted Cruz or Rand Paul as the 2016 Republican standard-bearer. But as Bush answered questions, he was applauded several times and drew cheers from the crowd that became more receptive as he made his pitch.\n\nThroughout the conference, attendees and speakers criticized Bush\u2019s support for Common Core educational standards and a comprehensive overhaul of the nation\u2019s immigration law, and those issues were at the heart of his conversation with Sean Hannity of Fox News.\n\nOn immigration, Bush criticized President Obama\u2019s recent executive actions and stuck by his idea that strong border security coupled with a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants already in the USA as the right approach. \u201cA great country needs to enforce the borders,\u201d he said, adding that there should be a plan so that immigrants can petition to have their spouse and minor children living abroad to join them.\n\nBush acknowledged there is disagreement among Republicans about a path to legal status for undocumented workers already in the United States, but he held firm. \u201cThere is no plan to deport 11 million people,\u201d Bush said, adding the steps toward citizenship should include provisions ensuring that immigrants don\u2019t break the law and learn English.\n\nOn education, Bush defended his support for high standards but said they should be made part of a comprehensive program that includes vouches. \u201cThe federal government has no role in the creation of standards,\u201d he said, adding it also should not be making decisions about what\u2019s taught in schools. \u201cThe role of the federal government, if any, is to create more school choice.\u201d\n\nWilliam Temple, a Tea Party supporter from Brunswick, Ga., led the walkout of Bush\u2019s remarks.\n\n\u201cThe Tea Party wants nothing to do with this man,\u201d said Temple, a familiar sight at CPAC events because he wears a the costume of a patriot soldier from the Revolutionary War. \u201cWe need a Ted Cruz. We need a Governor Walker. We need a Ben Carson. We\u2019d take Duck Dynasty before we\u2019d take another Bush.\u201d\n\nBush is perceived as the favorite of the Republican establishment, which turns off CPAC attendee Kim Garver.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a Jeb Bush fan. He\u2019s too liberal,\u201d said Garver, a Maryland resident who works for the Defense Department. \u201cHe\u2019s an establishment candidate who\u2019s being pushed by Fox News and Karl Rove,\u201d the strategist behind George W. Bush\u2019s presidential victories.\n\nAllen Skillicorn, vice chairman of the Kane County (Illinois) Republican Party, didn\u2019t plan to walk out during Bush\u2019s remarks but joined the group because he opposes a third Bush presidency. \u201cAmerica is about personal freedom, not a dynasty,\u201d he said. \u201cI want his donors to realize we can\u2019t win with him.\u201d\n\nBut Robbie Aiken, who works in government relations in Alexandria, Va., said he was pleased to see Bush \u201ckept rolling\u201d as the governor\u2019s critics tried to interrupt his CPAC presentation. \u201cHe seemed very prepared and he got across all his points,\u201d Aiken said. \u201cI\u201dm not saying Jeb is Ronald Reagan but he\u2019s as close as we can get right now. \u2026 Jeb is the real deal, in my opinion.\u201d\n\nContributing: Martha T.
