Ted Cruz thinks NASA should spend less time studying the planet and more time finding ways to go out into space.\n\nCruz (R-TX), who is chair of the Senate Space, Science, and Competitiveness Subcommittee, addressed his concerns at a hearing Thursday on the $18.5 billion budget request for NASA\u2019s fiscal year 2016. There, he asked NASA Administrator Charles Bolden what Bolden thought NASA\u2019s \u201ccore mission\u201d was.\n\n\u201cOur core mission from the very beginning has been to investigate, explore space and the Earth environment, and to help us make this place a better place,\u201d Bolden said.\n\nCruz wasn\u2019t satisfied.\n\n\u201cAlmost any American would agree that the core function of NASA is to explore space,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what inspires little boys and little girls across this country \u2026 and you know that I am concerned that NASA in the current environment has lost its full focus on that core mission.\u201d\n\nBut Bolden defended NASA\u2019s work here on Earth. NASA compiles data on the planet\u2019s air pollution via satellite, engages in research on new forms of energy, and is a key agency for climate change and ice melt data. Bolden alluded to the agency\u2019s study of climate change in his response to Cruz, saying that the agency can\u2019t do any of its work \u2014 on the ground or up in space \u2014 \u201cif the Kennedy Space Center goes underwater and we don\u2019t know it.\u201d That\u2019s not a hyperbolic worry \u2014 scientists have warned that sea level rise is putting the Kennedy Center, which is located in Florida, at risk.\n\n\u201cIt is absolutely critical that we understand Earth\u2019s environment because this is the only place that we have to live,\u201d Bolden said. \u201cScience helps exploration; exploration helps science.\u201d\n\nCruz said during the hearing that he worried about NASA\u2019s increase in spending on Earth science and, according to Cruz, its decrease in spending on space exploration (Bolden said he didn\u2019t have enough information on what Cruz included in his calculations of NASA\u2019s spending, so he didn\u2019t know whether he agreed with the Senator\u2019s assessment of the agency\u2019s spending). ThinkProgress reached out to Cruz\u2019s office for additional comment but hasn\u2019t heard back as of press time.\n\nCruz didn\u2019t specifically mention NASA\u2019s studies on climate change in the hearing, but the Senator has been outspoken on the issue before. Last year, he said that the earth had experienced \u201cno recorded warming\u201d over the last 15 years \u2014 a claim that climate scientists dismiss, saying that much of the warming has been going on in the deep oceans. 2014 was also the hottest year on record, according to NASA and NOAA.\n\nCruz also likes to joke about how cold weather must mean that Al Gore has been lying about climate change. Of course, cold weather in one part of the world has nothing to do with long-term observed warming trends.\n\nAlong with Republicans before him, Cruz has made the argument before that NASA should focus more on space exploration and less on issues facing our lowly planet. But for NASA, less time spent focused on Earth means less time gathering data on climate change and its impacts.\n\nThis rhetoric on climate change, coupled with the fact that Cruz had tried in 2013 to cut NASA\u2019s funding, led to worries about what Cruz would do in his role as chair of the Senate Space, Science, and Competitiveness Subcommittee, which he took on earlier this year.\n\n\u201cSenator Cruz has been playing to the most extreme elements of his party on climate change,\u201d Keith Gaby, communications director for climate and air at the Environmental Defense Fund, told ThinkProgress in January. \u201cHaving someone chair the Science Committee who claims there is no evidence of climate change in the last 15 years \u2014 when 13 of the 14 hottest years on record have occurred in the 21st century \u2014 is not an encouraging development.\u201d", "topic": "Climate Change", "politicalLabel": "Liberal", "organization": "ThinkProgress", "biasLabel": "Not Biased", "title": "NASA Administrator Gives Ted Cruz An Epic Lesson In How Science Works", "yellowLabel": "Not Yellow", "tags": "set(['CANADA', 'Space Exploration', 'Climate Change', 'NASA', 'CALIFORNIA', 'CLIMATE CHANGE', 'RENEWABLE ENERGY', 'DROUGHT', 'Ted Cruz'])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
