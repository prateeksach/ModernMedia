{"content": "The Navy Yard massacre won\u2019t revive the gun debate in Congress for a simple reason: There is no gun-control agenda this side of a total ban and confiscation that would have stopped Aaron Alexis.\n\nThe Toomey-Manchin bill could have passed Congress unanimously. The assault-weapons ban could still be in place. Gun-controllers could have achieved their long-ago goal of barring the private purchase of handguns. And every step of his mayhem at the Washington Navy Yard would have been unimpeded.\n\nThe media rushed, based on erroneous reports from law enforcement, to place in Alexis\u2019 hands an AR-15, the popular rifle that has been used in mass shootings before and that an assault-weapons ban would prohibit.\n\nThe front page of the New York Daily News blared \u201cSame gun, different slay.\u201d The newspaper\u2019s columnist Mike Lupica worked himself into lathers of dudgeon over the offending gun. \u201cThey call semiautomatics like this sports rifles,\u201d he fumed. \u201cYou bet. Mostly for the sport of killing innocent people, and killing them fast.\u201d\n\nLupica\u2019s screed would have been absurd if an AR-15 had been the murder weapon \u2014 hundreds of thousands of them are bought annually, by people with no interest in killing innocent people \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t. When the Newseum has a special exhibit on the journalistic history of going off half-cocked, Mike Lupica should be an honored guest.\n\nAccording to law enforcement, Alexis used a shotgun in his rampage. That is a weapon, as it happens, that has been endorsed and promoted by the vice president of the United States. Joe Biden sounded like a pitchman for Remington at a Facebook town hall earlier in the year when he urged a mother concerned about safety: \u201cBuy a shotgun, buy a shotgun.\u201d\n\nThis may be fine advice, but there should be no mistake: Shotguns are dangerous. When it comes to \u201cthe sport of killing innocent people,\u201d almost any gun will do, especially if it is in a permissive environment where no one else is likely to be armed. This makes a hash of the conceit that the government can ban a few select guns and make shooting rampages less likely.\n\nOther common panaceas would\u2019ve had no effect, either. Alexis bought his shotgun from a duly-licensed dealer, not at a gun show. He passed a federal background check with no problem. He didn\u2019t have a high-capacity magazine. He reportedly got the handgun or handguns he may also have used in the attack after shooting a security officer.\n\nSo the Navy Yard rampage demonstrates the essential sterility of the gun-control debate. It is true that James Holmes and Adam Lanza used AR-15s. But Seung-Hui Cho and Jared Loughner used 9 mm semiautomatic pistols. And Aaron Alexis used a shotgun.\n\nThe common theme is that they were all deeply disturbed young men whose acts of murder had a sickening aspect of utter senselessness. The Daily News got it backward. Its headline about the Navy Yard should have read \u201cDifferent gun, same slay.\u201d\n\nMaybe this time we can have a real debate about mental illness. To this point, we\u2019ve had a simplistically instrumental focus. It\u2019s like seeing a madman wearing a tinfoil hat to protect himself from radio waves and thinking, \u201cIf only we could ban tinfoil \u2026\u201d\n\nWhen Aaron Alexis called the Rhode Island police a month ago to tell them that enemies were harassing him with a microwave machine, it was clear that he was suffering paranoid delusions and needed help. But the authorities let him go his merry way, evidently to sink deeper into the madness he mistook for reality.\n\nIf we had the same callous disregard masquerading as compassionate nonjudgmentalism for people suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s, they would be sleeping in our streets and rotting in our jails. It needs to be easier to compel treatment for the mentally ill.\n\nThere will be another Aaron Alexis. If we can\u2019t predict what gun he\u2019ll use, we already know his mental state.", "topic": "Gun Control", "politicalLabel": "Neutral", "organization": "New York Post", "biasLabel": "Not Biased", "title": "The futility of gun control", "yellowLabel": "Not Yellow", "tags": "set(['Guns', 'Navy Yard Shooting', 'Aaron Alexis'])", "opinionLabel": "Opinion Article"}
