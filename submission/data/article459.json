According to Benton County Superior Judge Alexander Ekstrom\u2019s ruling, Stutzman is bound not to violate the law again and must sell all products to same-sex couples that she would sell to other couples, \u201cincluding but not limited to goods, merchandise, and services for weddings & commitment ceremonies.\u201d\n\nThis is a better result for Stutzman than the settlement State Attorney General Bob Ferguson offered last month. His original offer was a fine of $2,000, which Stutzman refused. \u201cYou are asking me to walk in the way of a well-known betrayer,\u201d she said at the time, \u201cone who sold something of infinite worth for 30 pieces of silver. That is something I will not do.\u201d\n\nStutzman may yet have to pay more. Damages for the same-sex couple, Robert Ingersoll and Curt Freed, have not yet been determined because appeals are still pending. Her lawyer, Kristen Waggoner of the Alliance Defending Freedom, continued to paint Stutzman as a victim in a response to WorldNetDaily. \u201cThe ACLU, on behalf of the same-sex couple also suing Barronelle, has asked the court to award them penalties, fees, and costs, which will financially devastate Barronelle\u2019s business and personal assets \u2013 including taking this 70-year old grandmother\u2019s retirement and personal savings,\u201d Waggoner claimed. \u201cThe message sent by the attorney general and the ACLU to the people of Washington is quite clear: surrender your religious liberty and free speech rights, or face personal and professional ruin.\u201d\n\nThis spin largely ignores not only what the judge said in his ruling, but also the Supreme Court precedent he cited. \u201cWhen followers of a particular sect enter into commercial activity as a matter of choice,\u201d the justices wrote in the 1982 case United States v. Lee, \u201cthe limits they accept on their own conduct as a matter of conscience and faith are not to be superimposed on the statutory schemes which are binding on others in that activity. Granting an exemption\u2026 operates to impose [the follower\u2019s] religious faith on the [person sought to be protected by the law.]\u201d In other words, Stutzman\u2019s religious beliefs do not entitle her to infringe on her customers\u2019 rights.\n\nFerguson praised Friday\u2019s ruling. \u201cMy primary goal has always been to end illegal discrimination,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m pleased that today\u2019s ruling clearly prohibits discrimination against same-sex couples.\u201d", "topic": "Gay Marriage", "politicalLabel": "Neutral", "organization": "ThinkProgress", "biasLabel": "Not Biased", "title": "Anti-Gay Florist Fined $1,000 And Ordered Not To Discriminate", "yellowLabel": "Not Yellow", "tags": "set(['Barronelle Stutzman', 'SAME-SEX PARENTING', 'FLORIDA', 'Alliance Defending Freedom', 'Washington', 'SUPREME COURT', 'NONDISCRIMINATION PROTECTIONS', 'TRANSGENDER', 'Nondiscrimination Protections', 'Marriage Equality'])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
