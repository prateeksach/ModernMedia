{"content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Thousands of people, many holding signs with names of gun violence victims and messages such as \u201cBan Assault Weapons Now,\u201d joined a rally for gun control on Saturday, marching from the Capitol to the Washington Monument.\n\nParticipants were led by Mayor Vincent Gray and other officials Saturday morning, and the crowd stretched for about two blocks along Constitution Avenue. Police blocked off half the road.\n\nParticipants held signs reading \u201cGun Control Now\u201d and \u201cStop NRA,\u201d among other messages. Other signs were simple and white, with the names of victims of gun violence.\n\nAbout 100 residents were expected from Newtown, Conn., where a gunman killed 20 first-graders and six teachers at a school in December. The rally was organized in response to that shooting.\n\nOnce the crowd arrived at the monument, speakers called for a ban on military-style assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition.\n\nEducation Secretary Arne Duncan told the crowd it\u2019s not about taking away Second Amendment gun rights, but about gun safety and saving lives. He said he and President Barack Obama would do everything they could to enact gun control policies.\n\n\u201cWe must act, we must act, we must act,\u201d Duncan said.\n\nDel. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D.C.\u2019s non-voting representative in Congress, said the gun lobby can be stopped. The crowd chanted back, \u201cYes, we can.\u201d\n\nNorton said the nation didn\u2019t act after previous mass killings, but she said \u201cwe the people,\u201d won\u2019t give up this time.\n\n\u201cWe are all culpable if we do nothing now,\u201d Norton said\n\nParticipant Kara Baekey of Norwalk, Conn., said that when she heard about the Newtown shooting, she immediately thought of her two young children. She said she decided she must take action, and that\u2019s why she joined the march.\n\n\u201cI wanted to make sure this never happens at my kids\u2019 school or any other school,\u201d Baekey said. \u201cIt just can\u2019t happen again.\u201d\n\nJames Agenbroad, 78, of Garrett Park, Md., carried a handwritten sign on cardboard that read \u201cRepeal the 2nd Amendment.\u201d He called it the only way to stop mass killings because he thinks the Supreme Court will strike down any other restrictions on guns.\n\n\u201cYou can repeal it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe repealed prohibition.\u201d\n\nMolly Smith, the artistic director of Washington\u2019s Arena Stage, and her partner organized the march. Organizers said that in addition to the 100 from Newtown, they expected buses of participants from New Jersey, New York and Philadelphia. Others are flying in from Seattle, San Francisco and even Alaska.\n\nWhile she\u2019s never organized a political march before, Smith said she was compelled to press for a change in the law. The march organizers support President Barack Obama\u2019s call for a ban on military-style assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines as well as for universal background checks for gun sales. They also want lawmakers to require gun safety training for all buyers of firearms.\n\n\u201cWith the drum roll, the consistency of the mass murders and the shock of it, it is always something that is moving and devastating to me. And then, it\u2019s as if I move on,\u201d Smith said. \u201cAnd in this moment, I can\u2019t move on. I can\u2019t move on.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s because it was children, babies,\u201d she said. \u201cI was horrified by it.\u201d\n\nAfter the Connecticut shootings, Smith posted something on Facebook and drew more support to do something. The group One Million Moms for Gun Control, the Washington National Cathedral and two other churches eventually signed on to co-sponsor the march. Organizers have raised more than $46,000 online to pay for equipment and fees to stage the rally.\n\nLawmakers from the District of Columbia and Maryland were scheduled to speak Saturday. Actress Kathleen Turner was expected to appear, along with Marian Wright Edelman of the Children\u2019s Defense Fund and Colin Goddard, a survivor from the Virginia Tech massacre.\n\nSmith said she supports a comprehensive look at mental health and violence in video games and films. But she said the mass killings at Virginia Tech and Aurora, Colo., and Newtown, Conn., all start with guns.\n\n\u201cThe issue is guns. The Second Amendment gives us the right to own guns, but it\u2019s not the right to own any gun,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are assault weapons, made for killing people.\u201d", "topic": "Gun Control", "politicalLabel": "Neutral", "organization": "New York Post", "biasLabel": "Not Biased", "title": "Thousands march for gun control in response to Newtown shooting", "yellowLabel": "Not Yellow", "tags": "set(['Game of Thrones', 'Hillary Clinton', 'the masters', 'Chess', 'New York Yankees', 'NYPD'])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
