{"content": "ANCHORAGE, Alaska \u2014 Anchorage police served search warrants at marijuana activist Charlo Greene\u2019s Alaska Cannabis Club after receiving reports of illegal marijuana sales.\n\nThe police took marijuana and impounded a Dodge Dakota and a Jeep Liberty on Friday, KTUU reported.\n\nGreene is a former television reporter who gained notoriety when she quit her job on live TV in September with an expletive and announced she was becoming an advocate for legalizing the recreational use of marijuana in Alaska.\n\nGreene, whose legal name is Charlene Egbe, told KTVA the club is a medical marijuana dispensary. \u201cWe don\u2019t sell any recreational marijuana. We don\u2019t sell any medical marijuana. This is a place for cardholders to come and share their own cannabis,\u201d she said.\n\nThe residence is home to multiple medical marijuana cardholders, as well as the club, she said.\n\n\u201cI saw them uproot a couple of marijuana plants. They took some bongs and pipes and phones and computers, and that\u2019s pretty much it,\u201d Greene said on scene as bags of items were carried out by police.\n\nGreene said she reopened the club on Saturday.\n\n\u201cBy opening back up bright and early, less than 24 hours after the local police department\u2019s failed scare tactic, we, at the Alaska Cannabis Club, have made it clear that the will of the people is stronger than any force they have \u2014 and we aren\u2019t going anywhere,\u201d she said in an email to the Associated Press.\n\nGreene said she was \u201cincensed\u201d that the police executed a search warrant on her instead of focusing on a stabbing and shootings that happened nearby just a few hours before.\n\nAlaska voters last year approved a ballot measure legalizing the recreational use of marijuana. But it\u2019s still illegal to sell the drug.\n\nGuidelines for the regulation of the marijuana trade are under consideration by the Legislature.\n\nAnchorage Police Department spokeswoman Jennifer Castro said it\u2019s \u201cvery important that people don\u2019t try to jump the gun until the state sets our other rules and protocols for the sale and commercialization of marijuana.\u201d\n\nNo arrests have been made or charges filed in connection with the raid.", "topic": "Marijuana Legalization", "politicalLabel": "Neutral", "organization": "New York Post", "biasLabel": "Not Biased", "title": "Police raid \u2018F**k it, I quit\u2019 TV reporter\u2019s cannabis club", "yellowLabel": "Not Yellow", "tags": "set(['Medical marijuana', 'Crime', 'Marijuana', 'Alaska'])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
