{"content": "HARRISBURG, Pa. \u2014 Republican Gov. Tom Corbett compared the marriage of same-sex couples to the marriage of a brother and sister during an appearance on a Friday morning TV news show.\n\nThe Pennsylvania governor was on WHP-TV in Harrisburg speaking about gay marriage when an anchor asked about a statement his lawyers made in a recent court filing, comparing the marriage of gay couples to the marriage of children because neither can legally marry in the state.\n\n\u201cIt was an inappropriate analogy, you know,\u201d Corbett said. \u201cI think a much better analogy would have been brother and sister, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nCorbett, a lawyer, former federal prosecutor and state attorney general, also said he does not think a pending legal challenge to Pennsylvania\u2019s ban on same-sex marriage belongs in federal court.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court left it up to the states to determine under their laws as to what is and isn\u2019t a marriage,\u201d Corbett said. \u201cThe federal court shouldn\u2019t even be involved in this. But if they say they are, then they\u2019re going to make a determination whether the state has the right to determine that a marriage is only between a man and a woman and not between two individuals of the same sex.\u201d\n\nMessages left Friday for a Corbett spokesman were not immediately returned.\n\nState attorneys in August included a reference to children in a legal brief involving same-sex couples seeking marriage licenses. In the court filing opposing allowing same-sex couples to intervene in the state\u2019s lawsuit to bar a suburban Philadelphia county from issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples, the lawyers made an analogy to a pair of 12-year-olds, saying if the children were issued a marriage license and tried to defend it in court, they wouldn\u2019t be taken seriously because the license was never valid.\n\nCorbett later rejected that analogy, saying the case revolved around the question of whether a public official had \u201cthe authority to disregard state law based on his own personal legal opinion about the constitutionality of a statute.\u201d", "topic": "Gay Marriage", "politicalLabel": "Neutral", "organization": "New York Post", "biasLabel": "Not Biased", "title": "Pa.
