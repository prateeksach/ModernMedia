The mandate overturned today would have required for-profit companies to choose between violating their constitutionally-protected faith or paying crippling fines, which would have forced them to lay off employees or close their doors. The plaintiffs in the HHS Mandate cases before the Court based their claims on the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), which passed Congress nearly unanimously in 1993. RFRA is a critical check on federal power and enjoys support across the ideological spectrum. The president\u2019s health care law remains an unworkable mess and a drag on our economy. We must repeal it and enact better solutions that start with lowering Americans' health care costs.\u201d Via Speaker's Website\n\n\u201cI am disappointed and deeply concerned by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision today in the case of Burwell v. Hobby Lobby. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, millions of Americans have gained access to preventive services without out-of-pocket costs, including birth control. However, this decision takes money out of the pockets of women and their families and allows for-profit employers to deny access to certain health care benefits based on their personal beliefs. Nearly sixty percent of women who use birth control do so for more than just family planning. It is no surprise that Republicans have sided against women on this issue as they have consistently opposed a woman\u2019s right to make her own health care decisions. Republicans have also blocked the Paycheck Fairness Act, which would bring us closer to the promise of equal pay for women. In the wake of this dangerous precedent set by the Supreme Court, Democrats in Congress will continue to fight on the issues of importance to women and their families.\u201d Via DNC Website\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s ruling by the Supreme Court is an important victory to protect Americans\u2019 fundamental right of religious freedom. Americans should not be forced to choose between giving up their business for their faith or giving up their faith for their business. I applaud the Court\u2019s decision today, which simply affirms the fundamental religious freedom that Americans have enjoyed for more than 220 years.\u201d Via Senator's Website\n\n\u201cThis ruling is a victory for freedom and another blow against the Obama Administration\u2019s unprecedented overreach into the lives of Americans. The Justices made it clear that the Administration does not have the power to force religious leaders and organizations in our country to replace their own moral standards with Washington\u2019s one-size-fits-all mandate. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision is also another reminder that the President\u2019s health care law was poorly written and continues to hurt more people than it helps. I am committed to replacing this law with a healthcare system that focuses on lowering costs and making sure that more Americans can get the care they need from a doctor they choose.\u201d Via Senator's Website\n\n\u201cBosses should not be able to impose their religious beliefs on their employees. This ruling is another attack on the rights of working people by the 5-4 conservative majority on the Supreme Court. At a time when tens of millions of women use birth control, there is no valid reason to restrict a woman\u2019s access to safe, widely-used preventive services simply because her employer does not approve of what should be her private medical decisions. This ruling undermines the government\u2019s interest in providing women access to preventive health care, including contraceptive coverage.\u201d Via Senator's Website\n\n\"A woman's personal health decisions about choosing to use contraception and when to start a family should stay strictly between her and her doctor \u2014 not her boss.

Our laws should empower Colorado women to make their own decisions based on their own beliefs, not the beliefs of the person signing their paycheck. Today's decision also underscores why I have fought to confirm mainstream U.S. Supreme Court justices such as Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.

I am deeply disappointed in the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores Inc. today, declaring that a corporation should be allowed to deny its female employees insurance coverage for contraception that its owners find religiously objectionable. This decision fundamentally discriminates against women, particularly those who lack the financial means to pay for contraception out of pocket. While the First Amendment protects the rights of an individual to freely practice his or her religion, I fundamentally disagree with the idea that a for-profit corporation is capable of religious belief. Hobby Lobby is a nationwide chain employing more than 13,000 full-time employees and earning more than $2 billion in annual revenue. It is organized as a for-profit corporation and its owners receive all of the benefits that go along with that structure. The argument that such a business \u2013 as opposed to its owners \u2013 has religious beliefs is an unfortunate, if predictable, consequence of the decision in Citizens United v. FEC. The Court has decided that the religious beliefs of a corporation\u2019s owners are more important than those of the vast majority of Americans who see no conflict between their religion and safe, legal methods of contraception. Decisions about a woman\u2019s health care should be made in a doctor\u2019s office, not in a boardroom. If certain contraceptive options violate a woman\u2019s personal religious beliefs, she is free not to pursue those options, but her employer should not be allowed to make that decision for her.The Court\u2019s ruling risks opening the floodgates for business owners who want to use religious freedom to exempt their businesses from offering any healthcare at all, or who wish to discriminate against LGBT employees in violation of state law, or against African-American employees or customers in violation of state and federal law. Although the Court\u2019s holding is formally limited to the context of contraception, recent \u2018religious freedom\u2019 laws proposed in several states show that there are legions of plaintiffs who will be eager to expand upon today\u2019s ruling. Our Constitution allows and respects all religious beliefs, but it does not provide an excuse for businesses to escape the responsibilities of generally applicable laws. I am very disappointed in the Supreme Court\u2019s decision and am extremely concerned about the abuse it now invites.\u201d Via Senator's Website\n\n\"Today, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of religious freedom by taking a stand with Hobby Lobby.

Today\u2019s Supreme Court decision unfortunately jeopardizes basic health care coverage and access to contraception for a countless number of women and I\u2019m very disappointed by the ruling. Blocking access to contraception will have economic and public health consequences that our country cannot afford.\u201d Via Senator's Website\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s decision is a victory for religious freedom. Religious freedom is one of our most basic principles and the very first right mentioned in the Bill of Rights.

I am pleased that the Court has ruled that the mandate is unlawful.\u201d Via Senator's Website\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision today makes clear that the government cannot force Americans to defy the basic tenets of their faith simply because they own a business. I am glad the Supreme Court has preserved our Constitution\u2019s protections of religious freedom from another overreach by the Obama administration. Republicans want to repair the damage Obamacare has done and prevent future damage. As responsibly and rapidly as we can, we want to move in a different direction to put in place proposals that provide more freedom, more choices and lower costs. We trust Americans to make these decisions for ourselves. That is the American Way.\u201d Via Senate HELP Committee Website\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s decision by the Supreme Court sets a dangerous precedent and takes us closer to a time in history when women had no choice and no voice. When 99 percent of women report having used birth control at one point in their life, allowing their boss to call the shots about their access to this critical health service should be inconceivable in this day and age. Your health care decisions are not your boss\u2019s business \u2013 period. Since the Supreme Court decided it will not protect women\u2019s access to health care, I will. In the coming days I will work with my colleagues and the Administration to protect this access, regardless of who signs your paycheck. Every American deserves to have access to high quality health care coverage and each of us should have the right to make our own medical and religious decisions without being dictated to or limited by our employers. Contraceptive coverage is supported by and benefits the vast majority of Americans who understand how important it is for women and families. It should not be a controversial issue.\u201d Via Senator's Website\n\n\u201cI applaud the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to protect the religious freedom of all Americans, both individually and collectively. The notion that religious freedom belongs only to some, and even then only in private, defies our nation's traditions, our laws, and our Constitution. And as the Supreme Court rightfully said today, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act could not have been clearer in saying religious liberty of all Americans must be equally protected and not unnecessarily burdened. That\u2019s why RFRA passed Congress overwhelmingly more than 20 years ago, and why it was so appalling when the Obama administration ignored the rights of Americans' and violated the law by adopting this mandate. While the Obama Administration and its allies have tried to make this simply a dispute over birth control, the Supreme Court agreed that the real issue is whether the Obama administration can ignore the law and, in doing so, trample religious freedom. Today\u2019s decision reaffirms the supremacy of our nation\u2019s laws and rights over President Obama\u2019s divisive agenda.\u201d Via Senator's Website\n\n\u201cI am pleased that this Supreme Court decision places some restraint on the reach of the federal government. I supported the Religious Freedom Restoration Act to ensure that core religious beliefs are not trampled by an activist government. This decision, I believe, strengthens the argument that Obamacare, which I opposed from the start, must be repealed and replaced with a law that does not infringe on individual and religious freedoms.\u201d Via Senator's Website\n\n\"Every American has a right to the free exercise of religion guaranteed by the First Amendment to our Constitution.

Bosses should not be able to prevent access to family planning and birth control for Alaska women. This is unacceptable. As Alaskans, we don't want the government intruding into our lives and telling us how to make personal decisions. Ninety-nine percent of women will use contraceptives at some point in their lives and this decision shows how out of touch the Supreme Court is with Alaskans. A woman\u2019s health care decisions should be between herself and in consultation with her doctor. I will continue to fight to protect all Alaskans\u2019 right to privacy and that includes a women's right to make her own health care decisions. I believe people, not corporations, have a right to practice their constitutional right to freedom of religion, but not at the expense of others. Whether or not to use birth control is a woman\u2019s personal choice and should be made by her in consultation health care professionals, not her boss.\u201d Via Senator's Website\n\n\u201cToday, the Supreme Court has issued a ruling that removes women who work at some companies from the decision making process about their own care and hands those very personal choices over to boardroom executives and human resources departments. While we firmly believe that every American should have the ability to practice his or her own faith, we cannot ignore the interests and the health of our nation\u2019s women. The pill and other contraceptives have had a profound impact on the well-being of women, giving them the capacity to make the best decisions about very personal matters for themselves and their families \u2014 and today\u2019s decision puts the well-being of many women in jeopardy. Action will be required to ensure that women employed by these corporations continue to have affordable access to reproductive healthcare.\u201d Via House Oversight Committee Website\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court is a defeat for women throughout our county and for the religious liberty that is enshrined in our Constitution. Bosses should not be able to make health care decisions about the reproductive choices of their employees. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act was intended to be used as a shield, not a sword. No matter how sincerely held a religious belief might be, for-profit employers \u2013 like Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood \u2013 should not be allowed to wield their beliefs as a means of denying employees access to critical preventive health care services. 99% of all American women use birth control at some point in our lives. Their interests cannot be ignored and must not be cast aside. When we passed RFRA in 1993, we sought to restore \u2013 not expand \u2013 protection for religion. We kept in place the core principle that religion does not excuse for-profit businesses from complying with our laws. Religious belief did not excuse restaurants or hotels from following our civil rights laws in the 1960s or an Amish employer from paying into the Social Security system in the 1980s. Today\u2019s ruling will unfortunately mean that for-profit companies will be free to impose their beliefs on others \u2013 their employees and patrons \u2013 who may not share their beliefs and who will be harmed as result. I am disappointed in the U.S. Supreme Court for today\u2019s ruling. I still believe that these sort of discriminatory actions by for-profit companies are neither protected by RFRA nor the First Amendment.\u201d Via Member's Website\n\n\u201cI am extremely pleased that the U.S. Supreme Court has upheld one of our fundamental Constitutional freedoms - the First Amendment right to practice our religious beliefs without government forcing us to abandon those beliefs for political reasons. The Green family, owners of Hobby Lobby, and the Hahn family, owners of Conestoga Wood, do not want the government to force them to provide health coverage that pays for something they find morally objectionable and an affront to their religious beliefs. This government mandate would have trampled on America's deeply held tradition respecting the freedom of conscience. Companies like Hobby Lobby, Conestoga Wood, and others providing health coverage to their employees will be allowed to continue to do so without having to aid in those practices that they find morally objectionable.

Clearly, no religious owners of a for-profit, closely-held corporation should be forced by the government to violate their religious beliefs and provide contraceptives to their employees. The Left claims this ruling violates women\u2019s freedoms, but it is un-American for the government to get involved in providing contraceptives to employees by coercing religious people to violate their beliefs to do so. It is ironic for the Left to scream no interference in a woman\u2019s decision to obtain contraceptives, but then to argue the government should interfere in that decision to fulfill a supposed \u2018inherent\u2019 right to contraceptives. I\u2019m glad today is a great blow to the political Left and the Obama administration. I applaud the Supreme Court for upholding the fundamental freedoms our Founding Fathers sought to protect and secure in our nation\u2019s founding documents. The First Amendment forbids government from adopting laws that force citizens to betray their conscience. The First Amendment also guarantees individuals the right to freely associate without losing their rights. You cannot force people to buy you something that violates their beliefs, in this case birth control, simply because you want it. A corporation is just like a church or a labor union. It is a group of individuals associated for a common purpose. Government cannot discriminate based on the identity of the speaker or nature of the association. Civilization is a society in which the rights of the individual trump the whims of the majority. This ruling is a reminder liberals seek to drag us back to Stone Age tribalism in which one can be subjugated to the tribe as a whole. The belief people can be forced to buy you something that violates their beliefs is the height of arrogance, greed, selfishness and brute force. The Court rejected that tribal belief and upheld the ideas upon which this nation was founded. You are an individual and no one owns your mind or conscience.\u201d Via Member's Website\n\n\u201cWith this ruling, the Court has allowed certain employers the freedom to impose their personal religious beliefs on their employees and has awarded another one of our precious constitutional rights \u2013 the right to free exercise of religion \u2013 to for-profit corporations. Despite the Court\u2019s attempt to single out women\u2019s health care in today\u2019s opinion, it leaves the door open to employers being able to deny coverage of other essential health services such as a child\u2019s vaccine or a life-saving blood transfusion based on religious beliefs. The ruling could also open the door for more for-profit corporations to challenge other laws based on their religious beliefs. A woman\u2019s private medical decisions should never be subject to the approval of bosses, politicians, religious leaders, or anyone else, and we are disappointed that the Court has abandoned this long-standing interpretation of the Constitution\u2019s right to privacy.\u201d Via Rep.
