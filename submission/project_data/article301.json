{"content": "TAMPA, Fla. \u2014 The 28-year-old son of a Florida fertility doctor has been charged by federal authorities with tricking his girlfriend into taking a pill used to induce labor and cause an abortion, killing the fetus she was carrying.\n\nJohn Andrew Welden was indicted Tuesday by a federal grand jury on charges of product tampering and first-degree murder and faces up to life in prison if convicted of the murder charge. He\u2019s also the defendant in a lawsuit filed in state court by his ex-girlfriend, 26-year-old Remee Lee.\n\n\u201cWhenever a woman is robbed of her ability to give birth and have a child, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any greater harm you can cause somebody,\u201d said Lee\u2019s attorney, Gil Sanchez. \u201cShe\u2019s devastated. She still can\u2019t believe this happened to her.\u201d\n\nDavid Weisbrod, who represented Welden in the first federal court appearance Wednesday, declined to comment to The Associated Press. During a court hearing Wednesday, Weisbrod characterized his client\u2019s actions as aberrant but said Welden had no criminal history. A U.S. magistrate judge ordered him held without bond.\n\nAccording to court documents, the couple met in mid-2012 and became romantically involved. Lee became pregnant in February 2013 and was elated about her pregnancy when she told Welden the news. Welden, however, urged Lee not to have the baby.\n\nIn late March, the records say, Lee went to the office of Dr. Stephen Welden, her boyfriend\u2019s father, for an exam.\n\nCourt records say Welden told Lee that his father had discovered she had a bacterial infection and had prescribed an antibiotic, Amoxicillan, to treat her.\n\nLee and her attorney \u2014 along with federal prosecutors \u2014 say Welden forged his father\u2019s signature on a prescription for Cytotec and relabeled a pill bottle as \u201cAmoxicillin.\u201d Cytotec, known also as misoprostol, is a drug used to induce labor.\n\nIt is typically taken in conjunction with another drug, mifepristone, to cause an abortion during the first nine weeks of pregnancy. Mifepristone, which is typically taken first, causes an embryo to detach from the uterine wall. Misoprostol is typically taken two days later to cause contractions and push the embryo out of the uterus.\n\nLee was six weeks and five days pregnant.\n\nWelden said she began to bleed while at work and went to the hospital \u2014 where she discovered that she had been given the drug used in medically induced abortions.\n\nCourt records say Welden told Lee while she was at the hospital that he had given her Cytotec, not Amoxicillin. Lee is suing Welden for battery, intentional infliction of emotional harm, and punitive damages.\n\nWelden\u2019s father, the doctor, has not been accused of wrongdoing and has not been charged with any crime.
