{"content": "Last week\u2019s Supreme Court arguments on ObamaCare struck me as a bit irrelevant, and not just because the case won\u2019t impact New York.\n\nThe case is about whether federal subsidies are actually legal in states that didn\u2019t set up their own insurance exchanges \u2014 but the truth is, ObamaCare is a bad deal even with the subsidies.\n\nDown here in the medical trenches, the harsh reality of the Affordable Care Act continues to play out.\n\nMy patients continue to report delays in signing up for ObamaCare policies and are rarely happy with what they end up with. They all have high deductibles and a narrow network of doctors to choose from.\n\nThis isn\u2019t their fault \u2014 it\u2019s all they can afford. Of course, without the subsidies, my blue-collar patients, many of whom work part-time jobs, wouldn\u2019t be able to afford ObamaCare insurance at all.\n\nKeep in mind that federal subsidies cover 75 percent of ObamaCare premiums nationwide, so if the high court upholds the written language of the law, and not the Obama IRS\u2019s decision to ignore that language, 7.5 million people will likely lose their coverage.\n\nBut, again, even with the subsidies, it\u2019s no bargain.\n\nWhen you use the insurance, you find that you have to pay out-of-pocket for your x-ray, ultrasound or lab work \u2014 and keep on paying for tests until you spend enough to cover your $5,000 deductible.\n\nYou can\u2019t afford the test, so you delay it.\n\nThe law is so heavy with restrictions and penalties, and so light with actual improvements to care, that it isn\u2019t working well even with the subsidies.\n\nYou also have to pay out of pocket to see your doctor (me) when you\u2019re sick, and even though I may charge you half price for a visit, you find that the prominent dermatologist I\u2019d usually refer you to for your severe psoriasis isn\u2019t part of your new network and won\u2019t give you a discount.\n\nThe skin doctor I come up with instead is less prominent and devises a treatment plan that doesn\u2019t work that well.\n\nHere in New York, the law has put in jeopardy the entire way I practice as a primary-care physician. The law is so heavy with restrictions and penalties, and so light with actual improvements to care, that it isn\u2019t working well even with the subsidies.\n\nI spend more than half of my time on any given day on computer documentation, pre-approvals, contesting billing errors by labs or hospitals and choosing unknown specialists from ObamaCare lists to refer patients to.\n\nI see no evidence that the federal subsidies are going to pay for essential health care. Instead, they bolster rising premiums and help keep insurance companies solvent and profitable.\n\nNow here come the Supremes, wading into ObamaCare deep water once again. If they enforce the wording of the law \u2014 so that subsidies can\u2019t go to those 7.5 million people in 34 states that refused to set up health exchanges \u2014 it should be the straw that breaks the back of the so-called Affordable Care Act.\n\nOr how about this: the final nail in ObamaCare\u2019s coffin.\n\nIt will be a happy day for doctors and patients everywhere.\n\nCongress and the president will have to come up with something else.\n\nObamaCare was falsely conceived. If Washington wanted to provide a health-care safety net for the have-nots, it could\u2019ve hired the doctors and built the clinics to deliver it.\n\nInstead, it built another bloated, self-justifying bureaucracy that makes the insurance companies richer and the doctors and patients poorer.\n\nHere\u2019s hoping that SCOTUS grabs this final straw.\n\nDr. Marc Siegel is a professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center and a Fox News medical correspondent.", "topic": "Obamacare", "politicalLabel": "Conservative", "organization": "New York Post", "biasLabel": "Biased", "title": "ObamaCare stinks even with subsidies", "yellowLabel": "Yellow", "tags": "set(['ObamaCare'])", "opinionLabel": "Opinion Article"}
