{"content": "Stipulating that none of the Secret Service lapses, revealed in the press over the past week, should\u2019ve happened in the first place, the only one that strikes me as truly inexplicable is the revelation that USSS allowed an armed felon into an elevator with President Obama at the Centers for Disease Control, and that they didn\u2019t know he was armed.\n\nThe two other big stories aren\u2019t as terrifying, at least to me. Inexcusable, maybe, but explicable. In the case of the fence jumper, I get why people on a security detail might let their guard down when the people they\u2019re charged with protecting are off site. And the inconvenient truth is that the Secret Service can\u2019t stop every determined person with a sniper rifle from taking shots at the White House from a number of different locations in the city. Maybe they bungled the response, but the rifle shots themselves were probably not preventable.\n\nThe armed felon in the elevator represents a different level of failure. There appears to be widespread recognition of this fact in both the media and in Congress. That\u2019s good, and important, but it\u2019d be nicer still if elected gun enthusiasts thought through the logical implications of their completely warranted outrage.\n\nConsider the following exchange from a Tuesday oversight hearing on Capitol Hill.\n\nRep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), who heads a House subcommittee that oversees the Secret Service, first heard of the breakdown from a whistleblower. The Washington Post confirmed details of the event with other people familiar with the agency\u2019s review. \u201cYou have a convicted felon within arm\u2019s reach of the president, and they never did a background check,\u201d Chaffetz said. \u201cWords aren\u2019t strong enough for the outrage I feel for the safety of the president and his family. \u201c Chaffetz added: \u201cHis life was in danger. This country would be a different world today if he had pulled out his gun.\u201d\n\nThis is all true, but it could use a little further unpacking. Chaffetz isn\u2019t a gun grabber. He\u2019s spoken openly about the fact that he carries a concealed weapon when he\u2019s in his Utah district. He cosponsors legislation that would erode state concealed carry restrictions by requiring those states to honor concealed carry permits from other states, including states with weaker permitting processes. (This would presumably apply to Washington, D.C., now, too.) And yet Chaffetz also joins the overwhelming consensus that Obama shouldn\u2019t have been on an elevator with a person carrying a concealed weapon because he fully grasps that people carrying concealed weapons can be incredibly dangerous.\n\nChaffetz is appalled that USSS allowed a person to carry a concealed handgun around the president without conducting a background check, but supports legislation to make it significantly easier for people\u2014many of whom come into lawful possession of firearms without undergoing background checks\u2014to carry concealed weapons around you and me.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to give USSS a pass. They should\u2019ve been aware of every armed person on the premises in advance of the visit, and followed protocol to keep them or their guns away from the president. But the man on the elevator was a security contractor at CDC. His employer issued him that gun. His felony convictions only underscore the dangers\u2014to everyone, not just the president\u2014of combining easy access to firearms with lax carry laws. But that\u2019s more or less the beau ideal for the gun lobby, gun enthusiasts, many Democrats, and the entire Republican party.", "topic": "Gun Control", "politicalLabel": "Liberal", "organization": "New Republic", "biasLabel": "Biased", "title": "Obama Secret Service Lapse Underscores Concealed Carry Dangers", "yellowLabel": "Not Yellow", "tags": "set(['Economics', 'jason chaffetz', 'gun control', 'Home News', 'The Plank', 'Guns', 'Culture', 'Politics', 'secret service', 'barack obama', 'Identity', 'concealed carry', 'politics', 'World', 'Books', 'Technology', 'Events', 'Film', 'Economy'])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
