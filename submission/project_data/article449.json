McCubbin, who received his teacher\u2019s certificate in September, enjoyed his experience at the school, so he did what most aspiring instructors would do: he applied to be a teacher.\n\n\u201cI walk into Dowling every day actually really blessed to be able to teach \u2014 or to substitute \u2014 at such a school,\u201d McCubbin told KCCI-TV.\n\nBut while Dowling Catholic administrators quickly offered McCubbin a position, earlier this week he got a call that brought his job application to a grinding halt: school officials told the 26-year-old that they could not hire him because he was publicly gay, which they claimed \u201cwas at odds with Church teaching.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt broke my heart,\u201d McCubbin told the Des Moines Register.\n\nMcCubbin says the school initially told him he could continue substitute teaching and coaching if he wanted. But after news of the decision prompted public outcry, the administration rescinded their offer. On Wednesday, school president Jerry Deegan tried to abate rising frustration by sending letters to alumni and parents explaining the decision.\n\n\u201cWe withdrew an offer of a full time position to a substitute teacher based on discovering late in the employment process that his lifestyle was inconsistent with the teachings of the Catholic Church,\u201d the letter to alumni read. \u201cAs a Catholic school we have an obligation to uphold the church\u2019s teachings as they are defined.\u201d\n\nTara Nelson, marketing manager for Dowling Catholic, further clarified to ThinkProgress that school officials were ultimately beholden to Catholic hierarchy.\n\n\u201cThis is a diocesan policy, and we have to follow the rules of the diocese,\u201d she said.\n\nAttendees pray at Wednesday\u2019s vigil.

On Wednesday afternoon, students staged a walkout to challenge the administration\u2019s decision, abandoning their classrooms and convening a protest vigil just outside the school. More than 150 students, parents, alumni, and supporters gathered for the event in the rain, with participants applauding the students before joining together in prayer. Attendees brandished signs expressing their disapproval with the school officials, inscribed with faith-based messages such as \u201cW.W.J.D?,\u201d an acronym for \u201cwhat would Jesus do?\u201d, and \u201cWe are not the gatekeepers to [God\u2019s] kingdom.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just want the community to know that this is a really important topic, and that just because our school officials or diocesan leaders might have made this decision, it does not directly reflect what we believe as students,\u201d Grace Mumm, a 16-year-old sophomore at Dowling Catholic, told the Des Moines Register.\n\nStudents signed a petition \u201cagainst Dowling leadership\u2019s hiring policies as discriminatory against individuals based on sexual orientation,\u201d and the budding protest movement even created its own Facebook page, \u201cDowling Catholic Alumni, Faculty, and Students Against Discrimination,\u201d which now claims over 1,800 members. The site serves as an organizing hub for the growing group, where protests are coordinated and supporters post words of encouragement \u2014 including updates from Tyler McCubbin himself. The page also includes testimonies of several LGBT Dowling Catholic alumni, with at least one openly gay student at the school who is advocating for a school club that would support LGBT youth.\n\nClaire Celsi, an alumni whose children also attended the school, told ThinkProgress she reacted to the news with \u201cdisgust.\u201d\n\n\u201cJesus included all different kinds of people from all walks of life in his ministry. He probably would have been first in line defending [the teacher],\u201d Celsi said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe they\u2019re directly following Christian perspectives \u2026 They should have just hired the right person for the job.\u201d\n\nCelsi also expressed concern for LGBT students who attend the school, noting \u201c[the administration is] sending the subtle message that [LGBT students] not worth as much as the other students.\u201d\n\nStudents at Wednesday\u2019s vigil.

Students of Skutt Catholic High School in Omaha, Nebraska are rallying behind Matthew Eledge, an English teacher and speech coach who is being fired for claiming his LGBT identity (a Change.org petition in support of Eledge currently has over 35,000 signatures). Meanwhile, a Catholic food pantry in Kansas City, Missouri, and a music director at a church in a church Inverness, Illinois are both suing after they were fired by their respective employers for being openly gay. And in San Francisco, thousands of teachers, students, and parents are engaged in a sustained protest effort against their Archishop, Salvatore Cordileone, demanding he abandon a new \u201cmorality clause\u201d for Catholic schoolteachers that would make it legal to fire people for being publicly gay. Similar fights are also being waged among Catholic communities in Miami, Cincinnati, Massachusetts, and Hawaii, among others.\n\nIn most cases, Catholic schools and institutions legally justify anti-LGBT discrimination by using the so-called \u201cministerial exception,\u201d a legal designation which exempts religious institutions from non-discrimination laws when employees are classified as \u201cministers.\u201d Not all schools have successfully reclassified their teachers this way, however, and Dowling Catholic officials declined to say whether or not the diocese requires instructors to legally identify as such. The nuance is important, because many argue that religious institutions who exclude LGBT people in hiring without the ministerial designation could be breaking the law: late last month, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issued a determination that a Catholic college preparatory school in Macon, Georgia, violated the rights of a gay teacher when officials refused to renew his contract after learning of his intention to marry his partner. If the school refuses to settle, the teacher could file a federal lawsuit to enforce laws that prohibit discrimination.\n\nRegardless of the legal back-and-forth over discrimination, however, Catholics such as McCubbin are still hoping church officials will reconsider their position on homosexuality.\n\n\u201cI hope there is a continued dialogue about discrimination and religion,\u201d McCubbin said. \u201cThe two together in the same sentence is a big oxymoron. It\u2019s ridiculous that an institution that preaches peace and tolerance and so many great things about human beings can still discriminate against people who are just themselves.\u201d\n\nThinkProgress contacted the Diocese of Des Moines to comment on this story, but did not receive a reply by press time.", "topic": "Gay Marriage", "politicalLabel": "Liberal", "organization": "ThinkProgress", "biasLabel": "Biased", "title": "Students Fight Back After Catholic School Fires Their Teacher", "yellowLabel": "Not Yellow", "tags": "set(['ministerial exception', 'Catholicism', 'SAME-SEX PARENTING', 'FLORIDA', 'SUPREME COURT', 'NONDISCRIMINATION PROTECTIONS', 'ministerial exemption', 'TRANSGENDER'])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
