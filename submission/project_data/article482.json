{"content": "Manhattan\u2019s flood of green protesters had climate-change skeptics seeing red Sunday.\n\n\u201cTheir love for the Earth is so real, they couldn\u2019t even use a trash can,\u201d tweeted a disgusted @chelsea_elisa, along with a photo of an overflowing trash can in Manhattan, after tens of thousands of marchers invaded the city on fleets of smog-producing buses.\n\nDavid Kreutzer, a research fellow at the conservative think tank Heritage Foundation, shared a similar photo of the marchers\u2019 refuse trashing the city\u2019s streets.\n\n\u201cSomehow this doesn\u2019t seem too green 2me,\u201d Kreutzer tweeted.\n\nHe and other critics of the People\u2019s Climate March called the protesters hypocrites for wasting paper and burning fossil fuel in getting to the big event.\n\n\u201cThe hypocrisy varies from person to person,\u201d economist Kreutzer, 61, told The Post. \u201cThe ones that fly in on private jets are the most hypocritical.\u201d\n\nHe was referring to celebrity A-listers who joined Sunday\u2019s march.\n\nStars such as Leo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo, an outspoken opponent of fracking, paraded through Midtown with people from around the country.\n\nHippies joined forces with gentrifying hipsters to decry what they called devastating man-made climate change.\n\nOne guy sported a witch hat and psychedelic pants while holding a sign that read, \u201cGoodbye Earth People.\u201d\n\nThe resulting traffic snarls irritated taxi drivers to no end, as marchers strolled from Columbus Circle to 11th Avenue and 34th Street.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mess,\u201d said hard-working hack Gamal Abovelwafa, 60.\n\nHe said the worst traffic was at the end of the march and around Central Park.\n\n\u201cWhere are we going to go?\u201d he angrily asked.\n\nKreutzer argued that it is unlikely that climate change will be the biggest problem of the 21st century.\n\n\u201cIt is phenomenally arrogant to think that 14 years into this century that we already know the greatest crisis we will face,\u201d Kreutzer said.", "topic": "Climate Change", "politicalLabel": "Conservative", "organization": "New York Post", "biasLabel": "Not Biased", "title": "Climate change skeptics call out marchers\u2019 \u2018hypocrisies\u2019", "yellowLabel": "Yellow", "tags": "set(['Climate Change', 'Protests', 'Marches'])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
