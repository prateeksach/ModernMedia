{"content": "After four brain operations, Margaret Figueroa thought she was prepared for anything \u2014 until she ran into ObamaCare.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m frustrated with the system. I feel like I paid but I\u2019m not getting what I paid for,\u201d said Figueroa, 49, who broke down in tears while explaining her bureaucratic nightmare.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s scary because this is America. I didn\u2019t expect to go through this.\u201d\n\nFigueroa \u2014 who has a neurological disorder \u2014 said she enrolled in a new EmblemHealth insurance program in February as required under the Affordable Care Act. And that\u2019s when her problems began.\n\nAfter paying her premium, she received a temporary ID card. But when she went to order medication, the pharmacists said her name wasn\u2019t in the system. And she said her doctors were not included in her new medical plan.\n\n\u201cThey just don\u2019t have enough doctors. Two of them are full to capacity, and the others aren\u2019t even in my radius. There are some who don\u2019t even speak English,\u201d the Arden Heights resident said during a press conference with Staten Island Rep. Michael Grimm.\n\n\u201cNow I have to find a whole new set of doctors. The doctors I had were familiar with my condition. I\u2019ve had my neurologist for years. You want to stay with someone who\u2019s been in your brain and knows what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nNot having a regular doctor has put her in a Catch-22: A patient can\u2019t get medication without a prescription from a doctor.\n\nFigueroa takes five different medications a day, including 60 milligrams of morphine.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been sick. I\u2019ve had chills, a lot of vomiting. The pain is unbearable. I\u2019ve had insomnia. I lost 23 pounds,\u201d she said. \u201cWho\u2019s going to write the scrips if I don\u2019t have a primary-care doctor? They\u2019ve been giving us the runaround.\u201d\n\nOut of desperation, she called Grimm\u2019s office for help on March 24. She now is at least getting some of her medications.\n\nGrimm, who voted against ObamaCare, was furious.\n\n\u201cThis is now becoming very common,\u201d he said. Of Figueroa, he said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t like someone who needs an aspirin here, this is her life.\u201d\n\nEmblemHealth declined requests for comment.", "topic": "Obamacare", "politicalLabel": "Conservative", "organization": "New York Post", "biasLabel": "Biased", "title": "Brain patient: ObamaCare makes it hard to find doctors, meds", "yellowLabel": "Not Yellow", "tags": "set(['Medicine', 'Health Insurance', 'Staten Island', 'ObamaCare', 'Healthcare'])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
