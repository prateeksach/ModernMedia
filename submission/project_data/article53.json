{"content": "Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a presumptive 2016 Republican presidential candidate, says he has changed his immigration stance and no longer backs comprehensive reform that would allow illegal immigrants to be penalized but remain in the country.\n\n\u201cMy view has changed,\u201d Walker said in a \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d interview taped Friday. \u201cI\u2019m flat out saying it.\u201d\n\nWalker in 2013 said a plan in which illegal immigrants can become United States citizens by first paying penalties and enduring a waiting period \u201cmakes sense.\u201d\n\nHowever, he is now saying such a plan is tantamount to amnesty, amid criticism that he has flip-flopped on that issue and others \u2014 including right-to-work legislation in his home state.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe in amnesty,\u201d said Walker, who finished second Saturday in the Conservative Political Action Conference\u2019s straw poll for potential 2016 Republican presidential candidates. \u201cWe need to secure the border. We ultimately need to put in place a system that works \u2014 a legal immigration system that works.\u201d\n\nWalker also is among the 25 Republican governors who have joined in a lawsuit challenging the president\u2019s 2014 executive action that defers deportation for millions of illegal immigrants.\n\nAfter calling the right-to-work bill in the Wisconsin Legislature a \u201cdistraction\u201d during his 2014 re-election season, Walker now touts the GOP-backed plan, which essentially stops unions from collecting dues from non-union workers.\n\nOn Sunday, Walker said that \u201cnow is the perfect time\u201d for the bill to be passed and for him to sign it.\n\nWalker also attempted to further clarify comments he made Thursday during his speech at CPAC, the country\u2019s largest annual gathering of conservative activists, in which he seemed to compare the Islamic State and union-backed protesters he has faced.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not comparing those two entities,\u201d Walker said. \u201cWhat I meant was, it was about \u2026 the leadership we provided under extremely difficult circumstances, arguably, the most difficult of any governor in the country, and maybe in recent times. To me, I apply that to saying if I were to run and if I were to win and be commander in chief, I believe that kind of leadership is what\u2019s necessary to take on radical Islamic terrorism.\u201d", "topic": "Immigration", "politicalLabel": "Neutral", "organization": "New York Post", "biasLabel": "Not Biased", "title": "Scott Walker admits flip-flopping on immigration stance", "yellowLabel": "Not Yellow", "tags": "set(['2016 Presidential Election', 'Amnesty', 'Scott Walker', 'Immigration'])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
