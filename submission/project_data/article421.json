{"content": "One in four New York newlyweds is gay.\n\nSince same-sex marriage went into effect July 24, roughly 1,400 gay couples have tied the knot citywide, according to data obtained by The Post.\n\nThe city doesn\u2019t know for certain how many of the 5,587 total marriage licenses issued through Aug. 12 were for same-sex couples, as officials removed the gender requirement from the application.\n\nHowever, since applications have hovered around 4,200 licenses for the same period the prior three years, it\u2019s reasonable to presume that this year\u2019s 33 percent spike is almost entirely due to gay marriage, City Clerk Michael McSweeney said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had to work extra hard to handle the increase, but even as same-sex marriage starts to feel routine here, everyone seems profoundly happy to be here,\u201d he said.\n\nThe only places that haven\u2019t seen a big jump in marriages are city wedding chapels, he said. It seems same-sex couples are opting for other venues.\n\nAugust is the city\u2019s busiest marriage month, and the office has had to limit its vacation policy.\n\n\u201cLast week, we averaged 335 license applications a day, busier than ever,\u201d McSweeney said.\n\nSome gay couples lining up to apply for licenses at the Marriage Bureau in lower Manhattan last week said they wanted their numbers counted.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s odd that they don\u2019t have data tracking how many of us are getting married. They should be able to figure that out,\u201d said Janet Wigfield, 59, who was applying for a license with her girlfriend.\n\nOther couples said they had expected the lines to be even longer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great, but I\u2019m surprised the number isn\u2019t higher,\u201d Miller Hall, 44, said of the 1,400 gay couples who preceded him and his boyfriend of 11 years, Vince Gatton.\n\nPerhaps couples are just taking their time, he said.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve waited 10 years to get married, what\u2019s a couple more months?\u201d he said.\n\nAdditional reporting by Helen Freund\n\njeremy.olshan@nypost.com", "topic": "Gay Marriage", "politicalLabel": "Neutral", "organization": "New York Post", "biasLabel": "Not Biased", "title": "Chock full of \u2018knots\u2019", "yellowLabel": "Not Yellow", "tags": "set(['Game of Thrones', 'Hillary Clinton', 'the masters', 'Chess', 'New York Yankees', 'NYPD'])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
