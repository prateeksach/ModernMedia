A petition must get 25,000 signatures in 30 days in order to elicit a response.\n\nIn the wake of the elementary school shooting in Connecticut that left 27 dead, Morgan has become a vocal advocate for tighter gun regulations. Specifically, he is calling for a ban on high-capacity magazines and assault weapons, as well as strict background checks on gun sales. According to the petition, Morgan\u2019s comments are no less than \u201ca hostile attack against the U.S. Constitution\u201d:\n\nBritish Citizen and CNN television host Piers Morgan is engaged in a hostile attack against the U.S. Constitution by targeting the Second Amendment. We demand that Mr. Morgan be deported immediately for his effort to undermine the Bill of Rights and for exploiting his position as a national network television host to stage attacks against the rights of American citizens.\n\nOf course, Morgan is protected by another constitutional amendment: the First. The CNN host has continued to exercise his rights by openly mocking the petition on Twitter.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers have promised to address gun safety immediately upon the start of the 113th Congress in January. Meanwhile, the National Rifle Association refused to cede any ground after the Newtown tragedy, calling for armed guards in every school and stricter scrutiny on the video game industry and opposing any measure limiting gun access.", "topic": "Gun Control", "politicalLabel": "Liberal", "organization": "ThinkProgress", "biasLabel": "Not Biased", "title": "Petition To Deport CNN Host For Gun Control Support Reaches 60,000 Signatures", "yellowLabel": "Not Yellow", "tags": "set(['POLICE', 'CLIMATE CHANGE', 'OBAMACARE', 'POLICE BRUTALITY', 'FERGUSON', 'Guns'])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
