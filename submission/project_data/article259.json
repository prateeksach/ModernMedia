{"content": "Critics who think the media has an anti-firearm agenda won't like the lineup behind a high-powered, upcoming seminar aimed at training reporters to cover the issue of gun violence.\n\nColumbia University Graduate School of Journalism, the vaunted New York institution that hands out the annual Pulitzer prizes, is sponsoring the session through its Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma. Also helping to bankroll the event, in Phoenix May 29-30, is Everytown for Gun Safety, the nonprofit, pro-gun control group founded by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. A series of speakers has been lined up and, critics say, it ensures reporters will be peppered with an anti-Second Amendment message.\n\nADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Of the 15 speakers at the workshop to train journalists, 13 are gun control advocates,\u201d said John Lott, president of the Crime Prevention Research Center and frequent opinion writer for FoxNews.com. \u201cAll the academic researchers who look at the safety and crime aspects of guns and all the law enforcement are strong gun control advocates. Journalism schools are supposed to train journalists to present both sides of the issue, not just present the views of their donors, in this case Michael Bloomberg.\"\n\nRelated Image Expand / Contract S.E. Cupp, (l.), is one of the few conservatives scheduled for the two-day seminar, while Roseanna Ander, (r.), of Chicago's Urban Education Lab, will also appear.

From the workshop description, it appears that the Dart Center sees most, if not all, gun crimes as part of one much bigger story.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to reporting on guns, local and regional reporters bear the primary burden,\u201d it reads. \u201cThey are often trapped into narrow deadline-driven beats with little time to develop expert sources, investigative angles or broader perspectives.\"\n\n\"There is no party line.\u201d - Bruce Shapiro, Dart Center\n\nNewsrooms are \"unprepared for the overwhelming, spasmodic tragedy of mass shootings,\" the description continues, before explaining that gun violence is too \"often viewed in isolation as random, inevitable tragedy rather than part of a wider phenomenon with complex causes but amenable to prevention efforts.\u201d\n\nLott said reflexively putting individual gun crimes in a broader context raises a red flag, as does involvement of Bloomberg's group, whose methodology has been criticized by Lott's institute in the past. A recent survey by the Crime Prevention Research Center found Everytown for Gun Safety, which publishes studies and statistics widely cited by the media, relies on economists and researchers who share Bloomberg's views on gun use in crime.\n\nLott, author of the 1998 book, \"More Guns, Less Crime,\" believes research proves allowing more law-abiding citizens to carry guns could actually reduce crime.\n\nDart Center officials told FoxNews.com that Everytown for Gun Safety has no input on the content that will be discussed.\n\nRelated Image Expand / Contract A screenshot of the workshop's signup webpage.
