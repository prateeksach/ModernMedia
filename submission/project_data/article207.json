{"content": "How many Americans know how health reform is going? For that matter, how many people in the news media are following the positive developments?\n\nI suspect that the answer to the first question is \u201cNot many,\u201d while the answer to the second is \u201cPossibly even fewer,\u201d for reasons I\u2019ll get to later. And if I\u2019m right, it\u2019s a remarkable thing \u2014 an immense policy success is improving the lives of millions of Americans, but it\u2019s largely slipping under the radar.\n\nHow is that possible? Think relentless negativity without accountability. The Affordable Care Act has faced nonstop attacks from partisans and right-wing media, with mainstream news also tending to harp on the act\u2019s troubles. Many of the attacks have involved predictions of disaster, none of which have come true. But absence of disaster doesn\u2019t make a compelling headline, and the people who falsely predicted doom just keep coming back with dire new warnings.\n\nConsider, in particular, the impact of Obamacare on the number of Americans without health insurance. The initial debacle of the federal website produced much glee on the right and many negative reports from the mainstream press as well; at the beginning of 2014, many reports confidently asserted that first-year enrollments would fall far short of White House projections.\n\nThen came the remarkable late surge in enrollment. Did the pessimists face tough questions about why they got it so wrong? Of course not. Instead, the same people just came out with a mix of conspiracy theories and new predictions of doom. The administration was \u201ccooking the books,\u201d said Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming; people who signed up wouldn\u2019t actually pay their premiums, declared an array of \u201cexperts\u201d; more people were losing insurance than gaining it, declared Senator Ted Cruz of Texas.\n\nBut the great majority of those who signed up did indeed pay up, and we now have multiple independent surveys \u2014 from Gallup, the Urban Institute and the Commonwealth Fund \u2014 all showing a sharp reduction in the number of uninsured Americans since last fall.\n\nI\u2019ve been seeing some claims on the right that the dramatic reduction in the number of uninsured was caused by economic recovery, not health reform (so now conservatives are praising the Obama economy?). But that\u2019s pretty lame, and also demonstrably wrong.\n\nFor one thing, the decline is too sharp to be explained by what is at best a modest improvement in the employment picture. For another, that Urban Institute survey shows a striking difference between the experience in states that expanded Medicaid \u2014 which are also, in general, states that have done their best to make health care reform work \u2014 and those that refused to let the federal government cover their poor. Sure enough, the decline in uninsured residents has been three times as large in Medicaid-expansion states as in Medicaid-expansion rejecters. It\u2019s not the economy; it\u2019s the policy, stupid.\n\nWhat about the cost? Last year there were many claims about \u201crate shock\u201d from soaring insurance premiums. But last month the Department of Health and Human Services reported that among those receiving federal subsidies \u2014 the great majority of those signing up \u2014 the average net premium was only $82 a month.\n\nYes, there are losers from Obamacare. If you\u2019re young, healthy, and affluent enough that you don\u2019t qualify for a subsidy (and don\u2019t get insurance from your employer), your premium probably did rise. And if you\u2019re rich enough to pay the extra taxes that finance those subsidies, you have taken a financial hit. But it\u2019s telling that even reform\u2019s opponents aren\u2019t trying to highlight these stories. Instead, they keep looking for older, sicker, middle-class victims, and keep failing to find them.\n\nOh, and according to Commonwealth, the overwhelming majority of the newly insured, including 74 percent of Republicans, are satisfied with their coverage.\n\nYou might ask why, if health reform is going so well, it continues to poll badly. It\u2019s crucial, I\u2019d argue, to realize that Obamacare, by design, by and large doesn\u2019t affect Americans who already have good insurance. As a result, many peoples\u2019 views are shaped by the mainly negative coverage in the news media. Still, the latest tracking survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation shows that a rising number of Americans are hearing about reform from family and friends, which means that they\u2019re starting to hear from the program\u2019s beneficiaries.\n\nAnd as I suggested earlier, people in the media \u2014 especially elite pundits \u2014 may be the last to hear the good news, simply because they\u2019re in a socioeconomic bracket in which people generally have good coverage.\n\nFor the less fortunate, however, the Affordable Care Act has already made a big positive difference. The usual suspects will keep crying failure, but the truth is that health reform is \u2014 gasp! \u2014 working.", "topic": "Obamacare", "politicalLabel": "Conservative", "organization": "New York Times", "biasLabel": "Biased", "title": "Obamacare Fails to Fail", "yellowLabel": "Yellow", "tags": "set([])", "opinionLabel": "Opinion Article"}
