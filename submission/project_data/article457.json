{"content": "Share this:\n\n\"Principal To Gay Student: \u2018Girls Wear Dresses And Boys Wear Tuxes, And That\u2019s The Way It Is\u2019\" Share:\n\nCREDIT: Shutterstock\n\nOpenly gay high school senior Claudettia Love said she would boycott her prom after her principal told her she could not wear a tuxedo.\n\nLove, who is a top student at Carroll High School in Louisiana, believes the objection has less to do with her fashion choices than it does with her sexuality.\n\nLove\u2019s mother told the News Star the principal said Love\u2019s tuxedo would wreak havoc on the prom. \u201cHe said that the faculty that is working the prom told him they weren\u2019t going to work the prom if (girls) were going to wear tuxes,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s his exact words. \u2018Girls wear dresses and boys wear tuxes, and that\u2019s the way it is.\u201d\n\nLove\u2019s sister told the News Star she overheard faculty members talking about her sexual orientation. \u201cIt\u2019s not about how they dress,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re judging them. They are at school talking about being gay is a sin. Everybody sins. The only person who can judge is God; you can\u2019t judge them.\u201d\n\nThe Monroe City School Board president said he would discuss the rule with Carroll High\u2019s principal, as he does not believe there is no school policy dictating student dress at prom. \u201cYou can\u2019t just go making up policies,\u201d he said.\n\nProm season is rife with gender policing, as schools enforce \u201ctraditional\u201d rules for how students can dress and who they can bring as dates. Love is only the latest student to be singled out for wanting to wear something other than what is expected for her gender. Wanting to bring a date of the same sex has also gotten students in trouble. One school in Mississippi even cancelled prom in order to prevent a lesbian couple from attending.\n\nThese rigid rules don\u2019t always spare heterosexual students. School dress codes, with their skirt length and neckline requirements, often target girls. Last year, one girl was kicked out of prom because the adult chaperones worried her dress was \u201cinspiring impure thoughts\u201d among the boys.\n\nThe ACLU has developed a special prom guide for students who want to bring a same-sex date or wear something different. Federal courts have repeatedly determined that schools cannot prevent students from bringing a date of the same gender, or require that students wear certain clothing based on their gender.", "topic": "Gay Marriage", "politicalLabel": "Liberal", "organization": "ThinkProgress", "biasLabel": "Not Biased", "title": "Principal To Gay Student: 'Girls Wear Dresses And Boys Wear Tuxes, And That's The Way It Is'", "yellowLabel": "Not Yellow", "tags": "set(['SAME-SEX PARENTING', 'FLORIDA', 'SUPREME COURT', 'NONDISCRIMINATION PROTECTIONS', 'Prom', 'TRANSGENDER', 'Gender Identity'])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
