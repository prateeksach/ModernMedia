{"content": "Westchester slay-suicide dad Sam Friedlander cruelly pressured his wife to have an abortion several years ago \u2014 and had a twisted fascination with their young daughter, his grieving father-in-law said yesterday.\n\n\u201cHe took inappropriate photos of Molly. Naked parts of her anatomy,\u201d Gary Perez told The Post after making funeral arrangements for his daughter, Amy, granddaughter Molly, 10, and grandson Gregory, 8, who were massacred by Friedlander early Tuesday in the family\u2019s Lewisboro home.\n\n\u201cIt was awkward around young girls. He put himself in situations that were strange, like having play dates with Molly and a friend, including him,\u201d Perez, 68, said of Friedlander, who killed himself after his murderous rampage. \u201cInstead of working, he\u2019d come down and have a play date.\u201d\n\nHe said other parents wouldn\u2019t let their children around Friedlander unless other adults were present.\n\nPerez said that several years ago, Sam, 50, urged Amy, 46, to abort a pregnancy \u2014 which she did.\n\n\u201cI will tell you the truth that I know. Sam didn\u2019t want to have more children, so he wanted her to have an abortion,\u201d Perez said.\n\nThe father\u2019s charges came after Friedlander\u2019s friends said he had been an emotionally battered husband.\n\nOne pal, Jerry Smith, a psychologist, said the mild-mannered lawyer sought him out for counseling, but never followed through, a year before Tuesday\u2019s rampage \u2014 in which he beat his wife to death with a stick of furniture, gunned down his children in their bed and blew his brains out.\n\n\u201cSam called me and said he was going through a divorce and would I be willing to sit with him,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI recall him saying that it was becoming an ugly divorce.\n\n\u201c[But] he canceled two or three appointments to get together.\u201d\n\nFriedlander and Amy had been due to appear in court for a divorce trial yesterday.\n\nSmith said he had to dismiss Friedlander as his lawyer eight years ago because \u201cI just felt like he wasn\u2019t strong enough. He was getting overpowered all the time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m shocked that a guy who I viewed as being so mild mannered and so non-confrontational would engage in such behavior,\u201d Smith said of the bloodbath.\n\ndan.mangan@nypost.com", "topic": "Abortion", "politicalLabel": "Neutral", "organization": "New York Post", "biasLabel": "Biased", "title": "Slay-dad abortion trauma", "yellowLabel": "Yellow", "tags": "set(['Game of Thrones', 'Hillary Clinton', 'the masters', 'Chess', 'New York Yankees', 'NYPD'])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
