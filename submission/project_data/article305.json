{"content": "ALBANY \u2013 Gov. Cuomo unveiled the specifics of his long-awaited abortion bill \u2013 but it\u2019s unlikely it will ever get a vote, The Post has learned.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t consent to that coming to the floor,\u201d GOP Senate Leader Dean Skelos told The Post.\n\nThe abortion bill, which aims to change state law to protect abortion rights should Roe v. Wade get overturned, was the most controversial part of Cuomo\u2019s 10-point \u201cwomen\u2019s equality agenda,\u201d which he unveiled the specifics of today.\n\nCuomo wasn\u2019t trying to hide the fact that the abortion bill is a litmus test for lawmakers on whether they are truly pro-choice.\n\n\u201cAre you pro-choice or are you not? That\u2019s the clear choice we\u2019re asking,\u201d Cuomo, who is Catholic, said at a news conference in Albany as a large rally was being organized outside by women\u2019s groups.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an affirmation to a women\u2019s right to choose,\u201d Cuomo said, adding that voters \u201chave a right to know how their elected officials feel on these issues.\u201d\n\nWhile Cuomo has support in the Assembly for his entire package, which he called a \u201cwomen\u2019s bill of rights,\u201d opposition to the abortion plank has been building in the Senate. A power-sharing agreement among independent Democrats and Republicans means that both parties have to agree to let a bill be heard.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re in agreement on most of the other issues,\u201d Skelos said.\n\nThe other points of the plan call push pay equity, and aim to curb human trafficking, domestic violence, and call for a \u201czero-tolerance\u201d sexual harassment policy \u2013 something Republicans call hypocritical given that Cuomo has backed Assembly Speaker remaining in office despite a sexual harassment scandal involving former Assemblyman Vito Lopez.\n\n\u201cThe Governor\u2019s \u2018Women\u2019s Agenda\u2019 should begin at home,\u201d state GOP Party Chairman Ed Cox said. \u201cIf he\u2019s serious about protecting women, he will appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Vito Lopez, who sexually assaulted his female staff members, and Sheldon Silver, who covered up sexual abuse with covert payments of taxpayer money.\u201d\n\nbdefalco@nypost.com", "topic": "Abortion", "politicalLabel": "Neutral", "organization": "New York Post", "biasLabel": "Not Biased", "title": "Cuomo unveils \u2018Women\u2019s Equality Agenda\u2019 including proposed controversial abortion bill", "yellowLabel": "Not Yellow", "tags": "set(['Game of Thrones', 'Hillary Clinton', 'the masters', 'Chess', 'New York Yankees', 'NYPD'])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
