{"content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Under fire for an ongoing showdown over funding for Homeland Security, Speaker of the House John Boehner said Sunday it\u2019s not easy to lead his rambunctious Republican caucus.\n\nConservatives dealt Boehner a stunning defeat Friday by rejecting a three-week funding measure for the department, which set Congress scrambling to avoid a shutdown before midnight.\n\nAsked whether he can lead the Republicans, Boehner said, \u201cI think so. I\u2019m not going to suggest it\u2019s easy. Because it\u2019s not.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut remember what\u2019s causing this,\u201d Boehner said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the president of the United States overreaching.\u201d\n\nConservatives want to block funding for President Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration as a condition to fund the department. In the tense Friday vote, 52 Republicans voted no, joining with most Democrats who want a longer-term bill with no immigration strings attached.\n\nUltimately, the House and Senate agreed Friday to a one-week extension.", "topic": "Immigration", "politicalLabel": "Neutral", "organization": "New York Post", "biasLabel": "Not Biased", "title": "Boehner says it\u2019s not easy leading Republicans", "yellowLabel": "Not Yellow", "tags": "set(['John Boehner', 'Republicans'])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
