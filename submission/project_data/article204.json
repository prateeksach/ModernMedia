{"content": "THIS is not the column about the Obamacare rollout I expected to write.\n\nIf you had told me, months ago, that weeks after the health care law\u2019s coverage expansion went into effect I would be writing about the problems its launch had exposed, I would have assumed I\u2019d be writing about rate shock, rising premiums and the disappearance of many cheap insurance plans \u2014 basically, all the problems conservatives have worried will make Obamacare a ruinously expensive failure if they play out as we fear they might.\n\nI may be writing about those issues soon enough. But for now there is a more pressing subject: The online federal health care exchange, the heart of the Obamacare project, is such a rolling catastrophe that it may end up creating a major policy fiasco immediately rather than eventually.\n\nThis fiasco has always been a possibility, for reasons inherent in the architecture of the law. When The New Republic\u2019s Jonathan Cohn, the most rigorous defender of the entire reform project, wrote up his \u201cfive Obamacare anxieties\u201d in May, the first one was structural: The system\u2019s sustainability depends on getting enough healthy people to sign up, he pointed out, and if they don\u2019t then insurers \u201cwill have to raise everyone\u2019s premiums,\u201d which \u201ccould create what actuaries call a \u2018death spiral\u2019: Rising premiums prompt people to drop out, causing premiums to increase even more.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nCohn thought such a death spiral was unlikely, and frankly so did I. Between the stick of the mandate, the carrot of subsidies and the planned P.R. blitz, it seemed as if enough Americans would sign up to at least postpone the cost problem and get the system off the ground.\n\nBut it seemed that way because it was hard to imagine the Obama White House botching the design and execution of its national health care exchange. Building Web sites, mastering the Internet \u2014 this is what Team Obama does!\n\nExcept this time Team Obama didn\u2019t. Like the Bush administration in Iraq, the White House seems to have invaded the health insurance marketplace with woefully inadequate postinvasion planning, and let the occupation turn into a disaster of hack work and incompetence. Right now, the problems with the exchange Web site appear to be systemic \u2014 a mess on the front end, where people are supposed to shop for plans, and also a thicket at the back end, where insurers are supposed to process applications.\n\nThe disaster can presumably be fixed. As Cohn pointed out on Friday, many of the state-level exchanges are working better than the federal one, and somewhere there must be a tech-world David Petraeus capable of stabilizing HealthCare.gov. And the White House has some time to work with: weeks before the end-of-year enrollment rush, and months before the mandate\u2019s penalty is supposed to be levied.\n\nBut if the fix-it effort moves too slowly, it\u2019s possible to envision a worst-case scenario unfolding. If the Web site doesn\u2019t work soon, even liberals concede that the mandate would have to be delayed, because you can\u2019t very well fine people for failing to buy a product they can\u2019t access. And that combination \u2014 a hard-to-navigate online portal and no penalty for staying uninsured \u2014 could effectively discourage all but the most desperate customers from shopping, which in turn would create an unsustainably expensive insurance pool, driving prices up and driving people away, and potentially wrecking the entire individual insurance market in short order.\n\nIf this happens, there will be a lot of schadenfreude on the right at the spectacle of technocratic failure. But the wreck of the exchanges may actually be worse for conservative policy objectives than a more successful rollout would have been.\n\nThat\u2019s because while conservatives think the Obamacare exchanges are overregulated and oversubsidized, they are actually closer to the right-of-center vision for health care reform than the Obamacare Medicaid expansion, which is happening no matter what transpires with Healthcare.gov. So if the exchanges fail and the Medicaid expansion takes effect (and, inevitably, becomes difficult to roll back), we\u2019ll be left with an individual market that\u2019s completely dysfunctional and a more socialized system over all.\n\nIn that scenario, the Democratic Party would probably end up pushing, not for the pipe dream of true single payer, but for a further bottom-up/top-down socialization, in which Medicare is offered to 55- to 65-year-olds and Medicaid is eventually expanded even more.\n\nMeanwhile, the task for serious conservative reformers \u2014 already not the most politically effective bunch \u2014 might actually become harder, because they would have to explain how their plan to build an effective, exchange-based marketplace differed from the Obama White House\u2019s exchange fiasco.\n\nSo while Republican politicians may be salivating over a potential Obamacare crisis, the conservative policy thinkers I know are not. They\u2019re hoping, as I\u2019m hoping, that this isn\u2019t as bad as it looks. The chance to say \u201cI told you so\u201d is always nice, but not if the price is a potentially irrecoverable disaster.", "topic": "Obamacare", "politicalLabel": "Conservative", "organization": "New York Times", "biasLabel": "Not Biased", "title": "Obamacare, Failing Ahead of Schedule", "yellowLabel": "Not Yellow", "tags": "set([])", "opinionLabel": "Opinion Article"}
