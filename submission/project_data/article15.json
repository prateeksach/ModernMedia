{"content": "The Huffington Post, through its widely viewed video service HuffPost Live, is promoting recreational use of marijuana as well as even more troubling nonsense about the medicinal value of hard drugs like ecstasy, acid and other Schedule I substances.\n\nWhen Miley Cyrus smoked a joint on stage at the European Music Awards and at the Art Basel Miami Beach festival, most saw it as reflecting the ills of celebrity culture.\n\nBut the danger of public acceptance and misuse is much greater when a significant media outlet promotes illicit drugs.\n\nThe most recent example was just this month in a HuffPost Live segment on the benefits of psychedelic drugs, like mushrooms, to treat depression. In the intro, host Josh Zepps talks up his own personal and seemingly positive \u201cholistic loving majesty\u201d recreational experiences with hallucinogen use.\n\nTellingly, the panel consisted of two authors on books defending LSD, mushrooms, acid and ecstasy, plus one libertarian presenting the pro-drug-legalization side.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t a single MD to defend (let alone challenge) the claim that psychedelics have legitimate medicinal value.\n\nA network that has had guests like Jimmy Carter, Elizabeth Warren, Bill Gates, Bill de Blasio, Cory Booker and others should\u2019ve had no trouble finding an expert physician to discuss this.\n\nWas someone too high to realize that having a doctor on the panel might be relevant to a segment on the power of \u201cmagic mushrooms\u201d to treat depression? Or maybe HuffPo couldn\u2019t find a doctor to endorse that view?\n\nIn a similar segment earlier this year, HuffPost Live host Alyona Minkovski joined author Tom Schroder to discuss how ecstasy can supposedly help heal illnesses like PTSD.\n\nThe problem\u2019s not just that the government classifies ecstasy as a dangerous drug with \u201cno recognized medical use.\u201d\n\nA scientific review of the drug found that even if it has therapeutic effects in some patients, it\u2019s still unsafe medically because of its \u201clasting neurotoxic and cognition impairing effects in humans.\u201d\n\nThe HuffPo host concludes by claiming \u201cthere are a lot of people in the medical community that are calling for at least more experimentation in this area,\u201d without citing who or what any of those sources are.\n\nNo doctor was on this panel either, nor were the risks of the drugs even considered except for host Minkovski to dismiss the dangers as government conspiracy and cast doubt on studies showing how ecstasy \u201ccan have devastating health effects.\u201d\n\nThe Huffington Post isn\u2019t just promoting dangerous theories on claimed medicinal benefits of illicit drugs. The host of HuffPost Live\u2019s recent holiday segment \u201cA Christmas Gift Guide For The Stoner In your Life\u201d openly promotes recreational pot use.\n\nHuffPost\u2019s Ricky Camilleri starts the broadcast discussing the legalities of transporting marijuana across Colorado state lines. No harm in that.\n\nBut one minute in, he gets to the main point, promoting weed: \u201cWe got a lot of the legal stuff . . . out of the way \u2014 let\u2019s talk about what people really want to hear about, which is what they are going to get for Thanksgiving and Christmas when it comes to weed.\u201d\n\nFrom there on out, the show is devoted to advice on cooking marijuana, using paraphernalia, getting high and giving cannabis-related gifts, without a single mention of the health costs of marijuana use.\n\nRegardless of one\u2019s views on legalization, marijuana is still illegal in most states and can also be harmful, especially when use is heavy and long-term.\n\nAccording to the National Institute of Health, a whooping 16 percent of drug-treatment-facility admissions are related to \u201cmarijuana dependence.\u201d\n\nWeb MD reports that marijuana can cause or exacerbate \u201cmental health problems like depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, short-term psychosis, and schizophrenia.\u201d\n\nStudies suggest that favorable portrayals of drugs in movies and TV shows can even lead to more substance abuse. How much worse the impact of the news media\u2019s positive portrayal, normalization and misinformation on drugs?\n\nHuffPo\u2019s coverage of the war on drugs and the debate over pot legalization is generally fair.\n\nBut its shows promoting illegal drug use and one-sided theories on the medicinal value of illicit narcotics \u2014 while ignoring or glossing over the real risks of drug abuse \u2014 are irresponsible and dangerous.\n\nSomeone needs to tell the Huffington Post to just say no to drugs or rename its video broadcast HighPost Live.", "topic": "Marijuana Legalization", "politicalLabel": "Neutral", "organization": "New York Post", "biasLabel": "Biased", "title": "The Huff Post\u2019s drug problem", "yellowLabel": "Yellow", "tags": "set(['Drugs', 'Marijuana', 'Huffington Post'])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
