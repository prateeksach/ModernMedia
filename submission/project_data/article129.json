{"content": "Last Thursday, the New York Times reported that President Barack Obama might announce his long-awaited executive action on immigration this week. The order, which White House officials insist isn\u2019t finalized, would give up to five million undocumented immigrants a temporary reprieve from deportation\u2014and, in some cases, permission to work legally\u2014according to the Times report.\n\nImmigration activists think it\u2019s clearly the right thing to do, Republicans think it\u2019s wrong, and I\u2019m honestly not sure who\u2019s right.\n\nThe precise details of what Obama has in mind aren\u2019t clear and those details matter. But the order would presumably allow the undocumented population to come in from the shadows\u2014to work and to live with family members here legally, without fear of suddenly being apprehended and sent back home. As I explained in August, such a move would almost certainly be legal.\n\nExisting immigration laws give the president clear and broad discretion to decide when and how borders and customs officials focus their enforcement efforts. Since authorities can\u2019t deport all or even most undocumented workers anyway, the president can tell them which ones to make a priority\u2014and which ones to ignore. By definition, any presidential order would be temporary; a successor could undo it easily. And it would not actually change the legal status of such workers. It would merely protect them from enforcement of U.S. immigration laws. That\u2019s still very important and would make a significant impact on the lives of millions of people.\n\nBut five million is a really big number. And whether giving a reprieve to such a large population crosses a line of democratic norms is still a murky question\u2014murkier than many liberals seem to recognize. This would be a major change to U.S. immigration policies, without any input from Congress and in the immediate aftermath of an election in which the president\u2019s party was resoundingly defeated. That\u2019s not to say the GOP earned a mandate from the election. They didn\u2019t. But Republicans won, and they were on the side of more restrictive policies. Given all of this, it\u2019s tough to argue that the public wants Obama to announce a big unilateral move on immigration.\n\nThe president\u2019s supporters argue that it\u2019s the Republicans who have violated democratic norms, by refusing to even allow a bipartisan immigration bill that passed in the Senate to come to a vote in the House. It\u2019s also unlikely that a move on immigration would set a precedent for future Republican presidents to undermine laws that Democrats support. I haven\u2019t been able to imagine a comparable scenario where a Republican would have considerable legal authority to make a unilateral policy change. Immigration is a unique issue.\n\nStill, Democrats could also lose some of their ability to claim the moral high ground on such issues. And that could matter very soon, because some Republicans are so angry about a potential immigration order they are considering using a government funding bill to block it, possibly setting up another shutdown. The last time the GOP shut down the government in 2013, they were clearly the party in the wrong\u2014they were the ones violating common understandings of acceptable practice in politics. This time, they\u2019d claim Obama was the one overstepping traditional boundaries\u2014and it\u2019d be a lot harder to say they were wrong.\n\n\u2014Danny Vinik\n\nNews from the weekend:\n\nOBAMACARE: The first weekend of open enrollment for 2015 went well.
