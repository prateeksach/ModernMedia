{"content": "Your unborn baby \u2014 or your job.\n\nThat\u2019s the chilling choice a Long Island woman claims she faced when her boss discovered she was pregnant with her third child, according to a federal lawsuit.\n\nCatherine Rizzo, 25, says there was no way to misinterpret her supervisor\u2019s ultimatum at Cooky\u2019s Deli in Bohemia in May.\n\n\u201cThe owner\u2019s daughter pulled me in the office, and basically told me if I didn\u2019t have an abortion, I wasn\u2019t going to have a job,\u201d Rizzo told The Post in a tearful interview.\n\n\u201cIt was very, very clear,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI have two other kids I have to take care of, and I needed my job,\u201d Rizzo added.\n\nCooky\u2019s Deli owner Martin Marsilio, 69, vehemently denied the allegation, calling it \u201ca total lie.\u201d\n\nThe struggling single mom said she was barely getting by on the $400 to $500 a week she earned at the deli counter \u2014 and knew she couldn\u2019t afford to lose her job.\n\n\u201cAs a direct result of this serious threat, approximately one week later, [I] was forced to terminate [my] pregnancy,\u201d Rizzo charged in a lawsuit filed on Dec. 19 in Brooklyn federal court. She seeks unspecified damages.\n\nThe unthinkable choice capped months of harassment, Rizzo said.\n\nA co-worker regularly cursed at her, pushed her and told Rizzo she was \u201ca lowlife and a bad mother,\u201d the Sayville woman claimed in her lawsuit.\n\nShe constantly complained to management, but nothing was done, Rizzo insists.\n\n\u201cI stuck through it all,\u201d Rizzo said.\n\n\u201cI stayed there because I needed my job, and I got the blunt end of the stick. I was trying to deal with it on my own,\u201d she said.\n\nDespite the abortion, she was abruptly fired in August, she said.\n\nAsked if she regretted her decision, Rizzo broke down in tears.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to deal with this,\u201d she sobbed.\n\nRizzo and her kids were evicted from their apartment, but she got a new job and a new place \u2014 until, she claims, employees of Cooky\u2019s started showing up and taking pictures of her at work.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve kind of overturned my life,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not stopping. I\u2019m just trying to keep my head above water.\u201d\n\nHer former boss claimed Rizzo was canned for being chronically late, and she had never complained about harassment.\n\nThe abortion claim is nothing more than \u201cfiction,\u201d Marsilio said.\n\n\u201cWe have had many female employees here that have gotten pregnant, had their children, took time off and came back to work,\u201d he insisted.\n\nMarsilio admitted tracking Rizzo down to a new job, he said, so he could prove to the state unemployment office that she was allegedly working off the books.", "topic": "Abortion", "politicalLabel": "Neutral", "organization": "New York Post", "biasLabel": "Not Biased", "title": "Boss made me abort: lawsuit", "yellowLabel": "Not Yellow", "tags": "set(['Game of Thrones', 'Hillary Clinton', 'the masters', 'Chess', 'New York Yankees', 'NYPD'])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
