Ted Cruz (R-TX) wants to strip the entire federal judiciary of its power to hear cases brought by same-sex couples seeking the right to marry, according to the Dallas Morning News.\n\nCruz\u2019s remarks came during a speech in Sioux City, Iowa, where the tea party senator also praised the original, more discrimination-friendly version of Indiana\u2019s new \u201creligious liberty\u201d law, and claimed that a cabal of liberals and big business endorsed a \u201cradical gay marriage agenda\u201d which says that \u201cany person of faith is subject to persecution if they dare\u201d disagree with marriage equality.\n\nJurisdiction stripping is a controversial idea that has occasionally been proposed by social conservatives seeking to neuter court decisions that they disapprove of. In 1981, for example, lawmakers introduced a total of 22 bills seeking to remove the Supreme Court\u2019s power to hear cases involving \u201cprayer in the schools, abortion, school busing, a males-only draft and state court rulings.\u201d Reacting to Sen. Jesse Helms\u2019s (R-NC) proposal to eliminate the Court\u2019s authority to hear school prayer cases, Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-AZ) claimed that the bill was akin to \u201coutlawing the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nYet, while successful court-stripping proposals are extraordinarily rare, and legal scholars disagree on whether stripping the Supreme Court of its full authority to hear an issue is even constitutional, there is a plausible legal argument supporting such proposals. The Constitution provides that \u201c[t]he judicial power of the United States, shall be vested in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.\u201d Thus, because lower federal courts are creations of Congress, federal lawmakers have the power to define the scope of these courts\u2019 power, and a bill stripping lower federal courts of their authority to decide a question would most likely be constitutional.\n\nAttacks on the Supreme Court\u2019s jurisdiction are more controversial, but they also have a plausible basis in the Constitution\u2019s text. According to Article III of the Constitution, in most cases, \u201cthe Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction, both as to law and fact, with such exceptions, and under such regulations as the Congress shall make.\u201d Proponents of jurisdiction-stripping claim that this power to make \u201cexceptions\u201d to the justices\u2019 jurisdiction includes the power to eliminate their power to decide certain questions.\n\nCongress actually did engage in jurisdiction stripping on at least one occasion, and the Supreme Court upheld its decision to do so. During Reconstruction, a military commander jailed a newspaper publisher accused of publishing \u201cincendiary and libellous\u201d articles. Though the publisher sought an order from the Supreme Court requiring his release, Congress stripped the justices of jurisdiction to hear the matter in March of 1868. That December, a unanimous Court held in Ex parte McCardle held that this jurisdiction stripping bill bound the Court.\n\nYet, while Congress may have the technical legal authority to take up and pass Cruz\u2019s proposed bill, there are two reasons why Cruz may want to rethink his proposal. The first is, as I lay out in my book, Injustices: The Supreme Court\u2019s History of Comforting the Comfortable and Afflicting the Afflicted, the justices have historically been a great ally to men who think like Senator Cruz. If Cruz sets a precedent for using jurisdiction stripping bills to resolve a modern constitutional debate, he should not be surprised if a Democratic Congress invokes this precedent in the future to revive the Voting Rights Act, prevent enforcement of the Citizens United decision, restore access to birth control and, if necessary, insulate the Affordable Care Act from judicial challenge.\n\nThe second reason why lawmakers should be cautious of jurisdiction stripping generally is that such legislation could potentially cast the law into chaos. Suppose that the Supreme Court sides with marriage equality this June, for example, and that Congress responds by enacting Cruz\u2019s bill. If the Court loses jurisdiction over marriage equality cases, that will mean that it does not even have the power to rescind its previous decision supporting equality, which will mean that every judge in the country will remain bound by a decision of the highest Court in the land, even if that Court can no longer enforce its own decision.\n\nSome judges are likely to decide, as Alabama\u2019s supreme court has suggested that it would, that they are free to go their own way from the Supreme Court of the United States. Other judges are likely to believe, correctly, that they are still bound by a higher Court\u2019s decision. In some states, lower court judges will be forced to decide between contradictory rulings from their state supreme court and the federal justices. In others, local officials will disagree, leading to a situation where a same-sex couple\u2019s access to a particular right will hinge upon who runs the office that administers or enforces that right. Eventually, statewide officials may step in to resolve these conflicts, but it may not be clear who within the state \u2014 the governor? the attorney general? the state\u2019s highest court? \u2014 has the power to do so. And even if one official does emerge as the dominant player in this struggle, their resolution of the issue could change if they are replaced in the next election.", "topic": "Gay Marriage", "politicalLabel": "Liberal", "organization": "ThinkProgress", "biasLabel": "Biased", "title": "Ted Cruz Threatens To Take Away The Supreme Court's Power To Decide Marriage Equality Cases", "yellowLabel": "Yellow", "tags": "set(['Marriage Equality', 'NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION', 'IMMIGRATION', 'POLICE BRUTALITY', 'Supreme Court', 'CRIMINAL JUSTICE', 'CALIFORNIA', 'Ted Cruz'])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
