{"content": "Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I. (Photo: AP)\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., recently condemned President Obama\u2019s proposed standards to limit carbon pollution from big power plants \u2014 pollution that is now totally unregulated. Conspicuously missing from the majority leader\u2019s argument was one simple, yet extraordinarily important phrase: \u201cclimate change.\u201d Republicans in Congress have no plan to address climate change and cannot even bear to utter the words. Even worse, the majority leader wants to impose on states his irresponsible plan for congressional inaction.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always so. Numerous moderate Republicans advocated for addressing carbon pollution in the not so distant past. But once the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United decision allowed the fossil fuel industry to cinch its death grip on the Republican Party, any hope for bipartisan cooperation came to an abrupt end. The Republican Party in Congress has become the political arm of the fossil fuel industry.\n\nIt\u2019s more than just not saying the phrase \u201cclimate change.\u201d As the majority leader\u2019s arguments reveal, Republicans refuse to acknowledge the costs. While they happily spread misinformation from industry-funded studies about the costs to industry of protecting our climate, they blindly ignore the costs of climate change Americans all across the country see in their lives already. Parched farms; intensifying drought; dying forests; rising seas; shifting fisheries; extreme storms \u2014 and the sober warnings of worse to come.\n\nThe good news is that the American people are not fooled. Americans want and expect their government to address climate change. A majority of Republican voters want action on climate change. According to one poll, most young Republicans, think climate-denying politicians are \u201cignorant,\u201d \u201cout of touch\u201d or \u201ccrazy.\u201d They are not fooled by snowball antics on the Senate floor. And while most of them are not scientists, they\u2019re not afraid to say that climate change is a problem that needs to be addressed.\n\nRepublicans in Congress who venerate our military ignore them when they warn of climate change\u2019s national security dangers. Republicans in Congress who are conspicuously religious ignore Pope Francis and other religious leaders when they warn of the fundamental indecency of not addressing climate change. Republicans in Congress who represent great corporations headquartered in their states ignore those corporations \u2014 Walmart in Arkansas, Coca-Cola in Georgia, VF Corporation in North Carolina \u2014 when they explain the business case for addressing climate change and are already reducing their own pollution. Republicans in Congress who root boisterously for their state university sports teams ignore the warnings of scientists and researchers at those very universities on climate change. Even home-state icons and industries, like the tick-ridden New Hampshire moose or the alarmed Utah and Colorado ski industry, are ignored by their Republican representatives in Congress.\n\nThis is not benign neglect. There is a massive political and public relations operation being run by the fossil fuel industry to create false doubt and plant phony questions to delay their day of reckoning so they can keep making money. Just last week one of their favorite go-to \u201cscientists,\u201d Wei-Hock Soon, was unmasked by the New York Times as having taken over a million undisclosed dollars from fossil fuel interests. It\u2019s the same game, and in many cases the same people, that Big Tobacco used for years to raise doubt that its products make people sick. Big Tobacco\u2019s scheme was so dishonest that a federal court found it amounted to a racketeering conspiracy.\n\nAs the evidence becomes clearer and clearer, and the American people move farther away from the deniers, the Republican Party must have its own day of reckoning, when it will finally again be able to address \u2014 or even mention \u2014 climate change. That day can\u2019t come too soon.\n\nSen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., is Senate minority leader. Sen.
