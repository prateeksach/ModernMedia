Orrin Hatch (R-UT) is one of six Republican senators who joined an amicus brief asking the Supreme Court to gut one of the core provisions of the Affordable Care Act. Yet the central claim of that brief \u2014 and, indeed, of the entire lawsuit \u2014 was rejected during the debate over the law by none other than Sen. Orrin Hatch.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act gives states a choice. They can either set up their own health exchanges where individuals may buy subsidized health plans, or they can elect to have the federal government set up such an exchange for them. Individuals who purchase insurance on an exchange may receive tax credits to help them pay for that insurance if they qualify on the basis of income.\n\nIn his brief, which was filed in a lawsuit called King v. Burwell, Hatch claims that the law \u201cprovides that premium subsidies are available only through an exchange established by a State\u201d \u2014 i.e. not in an exchange that is operated by the federal government. If Hatch, and the plaintiffs in King who make an identical claim, convince five justices to adopt this view, 8 million or more people are expected to lose their health insurance. Thousands are likely to die.\n\nYet, in January of 2010 \u2014 long before the King litigation made it advantageous for Republicans to claim that Obamacare treats federal and state exchanges differently \u2014 Hatch expressed the opposite view from the one he presents in his brief. Back in 2010, Hatch co-authored a Wall Street Journal op-ed laying out several reasons why he believes that the law is unconstitutional. In the process of making this argument, however, he directly contradicts the central legal claim underlying King:\n\nA third constitutional defect in this ObamaCare legislation is its command that states establish such things as benefit exchanges, which will require state legislation and regulations. This is not a condition for receiving federal funds, which would still leave some kind of choice to the states. No, this legislation requires states to establish these exchanges or says that the Secretary of Health and Human Services will step in and do it for them. It renders states little more than subdivisions of the federal government.\n\nHatch is incorrect that he has found a \u201cconstitutional defect\u201d in the Affordable Care Act. Although the Supreme Court held in New York v. United States and Printz v. United States that \u201cthe Framers explicitly chose a Constitution that confers upon Congress the power to regulate individuals, not States\u201d \u2014 and thus a federal law may not require a state to take a particular action \u2014 that\u2019s not what Obamacare does. To the contrary, as Hatch acknowledges, the law gives states an option to either set up a health exchange or allow the \u201cSecretary of Health and Human Services\u201d to set up an exchange for their residents. That is a choice, not a command, and giving states choices is entirely constitutional.\n\nNevertheless, Hatch does make an important claim about the law in his WSJ op-ed. A state\u2019s choice to set up and operate its own exchange \u201cis not a condition for receiving federal funds.\u201d That is the Obama Administration\u2019s position in King v. Burwell. It is also the correct position.\n\nAs a legal matter, Hatch\u2019s statement has less significance than similar statements by Republican Governors Scott Walker (R-WI), Bob McDonnell (R-VA) and Dave Heineman (R-NE), all of whom have also contradicted the central claim underlying the King litigation. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Arlington Central School District v. Murphy gives special significance to statements by state officials who are in the process of deciding whether to take a particular action that allegedly triggers the payment of federal funds.\n\nNevertheless, Hatch\u2019s statement is significant for two reasons. The first is that he made it in the context of an op-ed whose entire purpose was to lay out the case for why Obamacare should be destroyed by the courts. And yet, even when he was engaged in this very specific task, he didn\u2019t just fail to notice what he now claims \u2014 that the law itself gives each state the power to destroy much of the law within their own borders \u2014 he directly contracted his own argument in his King brief.\n\nThe second reason is that, under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council, courts owe extraordinary deference to federal agencies\u2019 construction of a statute unless that construction defies the law\u2019s unambiguous text. It is hard to believe that the law unambiguously denies tax credits to people in many states when four staunch enemies of the law \u2014 Hatch, Walker, McDonnell and Heineman \u2014 all shared Barack Obama\u2019s interpretation of Obamacare.", "topic": "Obamacare", "politicalLabel": "Liberal", "organization": "ThinkProgress", "biasLabel": "Biased", "title": "Top Republican Senator Explains Why The Supreme Court Challenge To Obamacare Is Garbage", "yellowLabel": "Yellow", "tags": "set(['NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION', 'Obamacare', 'IMMIGRATION', 'POLICE BRUTALITY', 'Supreme Court', 'CRIMINAL JUSTICE', 'CALIFORNIA', 'Orrin Hatch'])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
