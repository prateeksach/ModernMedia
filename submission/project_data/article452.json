Dennis Baxley CREDIT: AP Photo/Phil Sears\n\nLawmakers in Florida are trying to repeal an unconstitutional, unenforceable statute banning adoption for same-sex couples. The bill that would take the overturned law off the books is part of a larger piece of legislation (HB 7013) designed to incentivize adoption in the state by allowing for homeschooling of adoptees and providing more support services for families who adopt. It passed the House in March, but one lawmaker is still defending his vote against it.\n\nSpeaking in various radio interviews last week, state Rep. Dennis Baxley (R) explained that after initially supporting the bill, he prayed on it and decided that he had to reverse his vote because he couldn\u2019t affirm homosexuality. \u201cIf you get it wrong you need to own it and you need to seek forgiveness, and that\u2019s where I\u2019ve been with this,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t hate anybody. I don\u2019t want to discriminate against anybody. I\u2019m not phobic, but I simply can\u2019t affirm homosexuality. My compass won\u2019t go there, knowing what I know biblically. And so I ask people to please understand the circumstances.\u201d Baxley said that his sin was resigning himself to the idea that the issue had been lost in the courts already.\n\n\u201cI could save some kids, but that rationale breaks down in the bigger picture. And so in prayer and in a moment of moral clarity the next morning it was just, \u2018Dennis, you\u2019ve affirmed homosexuality, that won\u2019t work. You can\u2019t be there.'\u201d\n\nListen to his comments:\n\nDespite Baxley\u2019s acknowledgment that the state\u2019s kids actually benefit if there are same-sex couples eligible to adopt them, he is now supporting a revenge bill that would entitle private adoption agencies to refuse to serve same-sex couples because of their religious beliefs \u2014 and still receive state funding. He worries that if it violates an agency\u2019s mission to \u201carrange homosexual adoptions,\u201d then \u201cthey are going to have to get out of that business and have in some cases.\u201d In 2013, Baxley compared same-sex couples raising children to parents who abuse their children or have drug or alcohol problems. Baxley is himself the father of two adopted children.\n\nSo far, no Florida agency has closed for that reason. In other states where Catholic Charities shut down after the arrival of marriage equality, like Massachusetts and Illinois, the state forced nothing upon them. Rather than function without state funding or agree not to discriminate, they voluntarily shut themselves down.\n\nSeveral Marion County Republicans are upset with Baxley for changing his vote after the fact, particularly because he may have influenced others to support the bill. Randy Osborne, chairman of the Marion County Republican Party, called the reversal \u201cdamaging,\u201d noting that several other representatives voted for it because of Baxley\u2019s speech on the floor. \u201cThe damage is done,\u201d Osborne said. \u201cYou cannot take that back.\u201d", "topic": "Gay Marriage", "politicalLabel": "Liberal", "organization": "ThinkProgress", "biasLabel": "Biased", "title": "Florida Lawmaker Reversed Adoption Bill Vote Because 'I Simply Can't Affirm Homosexuality'", "yellowLabel": "Yellow", "tags": "set(['Same-sex Parenting', 'Florida', 'SAME-SEX PARENTING', 'FLORIDA', 'SUPREME COURT', 'NONDISCRIMINATION PROTECTIONS', 'Adoption', 'TRANSGENDER', 'Dennis Baxley'])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
