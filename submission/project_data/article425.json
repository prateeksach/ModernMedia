{"content": "Few political allegiances are more inexplicable than the love affair between Bill Clinton and America\u2019s LGBT community.\n\nDuring his eight years in office, our 42nd president not only introduced the military\u2019s disastrous Don\u2019t Ask/Don\u2019t Tell policy in 1993, he also furthered the ban prohibiting HIV-positive travelers from entering the US, failed to pass the Employee Non-Discrimination Act and showed questionable leadership in easing approval for crucial HIV medications.\n\nIf that weren\u2019t enough, Clinton signed into law the Defense of Marriage Act, which prevented same-sex married couples from receiving federal benefits and recognition.\n\nAs author and academic Nathaniel Frank explains, \u201cClinton will go down in history as the only president who signed \u2026 federal laws mandating discrimination against gay and lesbian Americans.\u201d\n\nYet this Saturday in Washington, DC, the same Bill Clinton will be welcomed as keynote speaker at the 18th annual national dinner of the Human Rights Campaign \u2014 America\u2019s largest LGBT rights group.\n\nCalling him a \u201ctransformational leader for our nation and the world,\u201d HRC president Chad Griffin has said he\u2019s \u201cthrilled\u201d Clinton will once again appear at the sold-out black-tie event.\n\nThe choice of Clinton to address American LGBT leaders is a farce of Faustian proportions \u2014 as if the NAACP had invited George Wallace as headliner.\n\nHRC says Clinton\u2019s Washington-era transgressions are now history \u2014 rendered moot by his myriad mea culpas and the numerous LGBT-rights achievements of the Obama administration.\n\nSure, DOMA might have been state-sanctioned discrimination not seen since the time of Jim Crow, but Clinton\u2019s past sins are now \u201cold news,\u201d said HRC VP for communications and marketing Fred Sainz, who in an act of revisionism bordering on the sycophantic, added, \u201cPresident Clinton has consistently been a supporter of LGBT people and issues important to us.\u201d\n\nOf course, it would have taken courage to stand up for gay rights when it was the unpopular thing to do. Now it\u2019s just pandering.\n\nPhrases like \u201cold news\u201d reveal just how out of touch \u201cmainstream\u201d progressive groups like HRC have become with actual progressives.\n\nCosseted by big egos and even bigger salaries \u2014 in Griffin\u2019s case, over $360,000 annually \u2014 folks like Griffin and Sainz may indeed view Clinton\u2019s past as irrelevant.\n\nBut for many of the thousands of lives it destroyed, the consequences of Clinton\u2019s presidency still reverberate as strongly as ever.\n\nMore than 25,000 bi-national LGBT couples, for example, lived with the cost and terror of potential deportation prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s overturning of DOMA last year.\n\nAnd as a result of DADT, some 14,000-plus soldiers were booted from the military between 1994 and 2011 \u2014 including hundreds of highly specialized linguistic and security experts who could have come in handy after 9/11.\n\n\u201cClinton may have expended real political capital to end the ban on gays in the military, but he botched the effort and ultimately failed,\u201d says Frank, whose 2009 book \u201cUnfriendly Fire\u201d is considered the definitive analysis of DADT.\n\nThat failure \u2014 along with DOMA\u2019s onerous effects \u2014 will forever remain \u201can indelible part of the Clinton legacy.\u201d\n\nWith Hillary Clinton likely running for the White House, it\u2019s easy to understand Clinton\u2019s attraction to HRC. An HRC stamp of approval helps rehabilitate Bill\u2019s dubious LGBT record while appealing to a key constituency Hillary needs to secure the presidency.\n\nBut like her husband, Hillary has also flip-flopped on LGBT rights \u2014 so much so that the Economist described her \u201cbelated conversion\u201d to supporting marriage equality as \u201ccautious to the point of cowardice\u201d back in March 2013.\n\nThe choice of Clinton to address American LGBT leaders is a farce of Faustian proportions \u2014 as if the NAACP had invited George Wallace as headliner.\n\nIn embracing Bill and Hillary, no minority group has so thoroughly sold out its base like HRC and its ilk as they scrounge for status in Washington.\n\nThe Clintons, meanwhile, relearn the lesson that no matter how poorly they treat their constituents, they\u2019ll come back.\n\nI tried to ask Griffin about HRC\u2019s invitation to Clinton, but he refused to comment.\n\nInstead, an HRC flak cited Clinton\u2019s regret over DADT and DOMA along with a list of Hillary and Chelsea Clinton\u2019s pro-LGBT achievements.\n\nArrogant and incredulous, HRC\u2019s response betrayed a strain of left-wing impunity which masquerades as progressivism but is actually steeped in elitism.\n\nOthers, however, are far less forgiving \u2014 of Clinton\u2019s misdeeds and HRC for absolving them.\n\n\u201cClinton has sort of washed his slate clean, and now everybody seems to love him, but both he or the HRC provide little of permanent value to us,\u201d says long-time author and activist Larry Kramer, whose semi-autobiographical play \u201cThe Normal Heart\u201d was recently adapted for television by HBO. \u201cTo be frank, Clinton isn\u2019t entitled to support from gay people. So HRC is welcome to Clinton, because neither has delivered, as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d\n\nDavid Kaufman is the real estate and travel editor of The Post.", "topic": "Gay Marriage", "politicalLabel": "Liberal", "organization": "New York Post", "biasLabel": "Biased", "title": "How the gay community shamefully lets Clintons off the hook", "yellowLabel": "Yellow", "tags": "set(['Gay Rights', 'Bill Clinton', 'Hillary Clinton', 'Human Rights Campaign', 'LGBT', 'Clintons'])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
