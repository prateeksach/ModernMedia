{"content": "Early one morning in April, DEA and IRS agents and U.S. marshals raided several Oakland properties owned by Richard Lee, then the leading figure of California\u2019s medical-marijuana industry. At Oaksterdam University, Lee\u2019s multistory business school for marijuana workers, agents went in with power saws, a sledgehammer, and a small battering ram, and walked out with file drawers and bags full of loose documents. At Lee's dispensary down the block, they heaped live cannabis plants into trash bags. Word got out, and soon hundreds of protesters surrounded Oaksterdam, screaming \u201cFuck you, pigs!\u201d at the officers. Some of the agitators milled around all day, hoisting signs, blocking the road, and, yes, smoking pot.\n\nA more sober cohort also joined the protest\u2014officials from the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 5. The UFCW had been unionizing marijuana workers since 2010, when it organized the Lee-owned businesses that were now blocked off by fluttering caution tape. At the height of the UFCW\u2019s efforts, more than 2,000 cannabis workers, most of whom worked behind the counter selling medicinal marijuana in Western states, had signed a union contract. But federal raids have sent that figure nose-diving to 500 or so workers today. With the raid on Oaksterdam, not only had the federal government shuttered the most reputable marijuana business in the state; they had shuttered the largest union shop, of some 100 UFCW workers, in the entire cannabis industry.\n\n\u201cIn this industry, workers are severely oppressed,\u201d Dan Rush, the head of the UFCW\u2019s cannabis division, said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not by, necessarily, the employers. It\u2019s more by an ignorant social and political environment.\u201d And that includes the White House, he added: \u201cA president who did not do what he said he would before he was elected.\u201d Indeed, when Local 5 first began to organize marijuana workers, management generally refrained from interfering, in the hopes that the union would gradually help make the political environment friendlier. The understanding, one organizer said, \u201cis that our presence would be like a sign that their businesses were legitimate and well-regulated, just like they had been telling people.\u201d Union officials further promised to apply their political muscle to support bills and elected officials who supported decriminalizing or legalizing marijuana. The union's reward: hundreds of pot workers added to its rolls every year.\n\nTo an extent, this loose partnership has functioned well at the state level. The UFCW has been an unseen force in nearly every big push to pass marijuana-friendly laws and ordinances in Western states like California and Colorado. But federal crackdowns on pot retailers remain a constant bugbear, threatening to dry up one of the UFCW\u2019s best streams for new membership. And while unions aren\u2019t afraid to stare down large employers, they\u2019re outmatched by the federal government. \u201cWe, through our international union back in D.C., are going to bend anybody\u2019s ear who is going to listen to us about changing federal law,\u201d said John Hughes, a cannabis division rep who works with the Local 5. \u201cBut we can\u2019t stop the DOJ.\u201d And when the Justice Department does come after marijuana workers, \u201chaving the union there doesn\u2019t protect them at all.\u201d\n\nFor a union with 1.3 million members, the elimination of 1,500 union jobs may seem negligible. It is not. New collective-bargaining restrictions, antiquated federal laws, the Great Recession, and greater hostility toward unions\u2014by both the private sector and Republican-controlled statehouses\u2014have collaborated to bring organized labor to its lowest membership levels since World War II. Unions have been forced to get creative, and now count victories in the low thousands, rather than the tens or hundreds of thousands. In 2012, one of the UFCW\u2019s biggest wins was a neutrality agreement to organize around 2,000 workers at 22 Raley\u2019s grocery stores in California. While their battle with Raley\u2019s culminated in a nine-day strike, the UFCW has organized more than half of its weed employees after first reaching out to management, not workers. Instead of picketing sidewalks, said Matt Witemyre, who helped organize the large Oakland grower Medi-Cone, \u201cWe take [management] out to lunch. We show them our brochures, we tell them what we can do \u2026 and then we start the organizing process.\u201d\n\nThis approach works for two reasons. Especially in California, organizers said, many of the dispensaries\u2019 owner-operators are, true to stereotype, hippies; union-busting just isn\u2019t in their DNA. Meanwhile, MBA-wielding pot entrepreneurs believe that letting unions through the door legitimizes their business. Mark Belkin, the organizing director for UFCW Local 7 in Colorado, said that as more states and municipalities legalize pot and the industry grows to its natural size, it\u2019s not unfathomable that the union could keep apace, organizing a majority of pot workspaces and setting the general working standards for the entire industry. Officials at the UFCW International, too, have come to see the cannabis business as a smart place to focus expansion efforts. At an informal talk at a UFCW growth summit in 2011, its executive vice president, Pat O\u2019Neill, boasted to organizers that the union had finally found a true \u201cgrowth industry.\u201d That summer, the union\u2019s international executive board signaled that it considered marijuana retail one of its core industries by creating the Medical Cannabis and Hemp Division\u2014only the union\u2019s fourth division, along with retail grocery, non-food retail, and meatpacking and food processing\u2014which gives organizers access to funding and dedicated staff. Soon, the division will have its own, discrete budget, and its chief hopes to bring workers to the table with Sen. Patrick Leahy, who has scheduled a hearing for early this year on reconciling the differences between state and federal marijuana laws. (Meanwhile, this week, Rep. Earl Blumenauer and Rep. Jared Polis plan to introduce a bill that would make it federally permissible for states to legalize pot.)\n\nRelations between the UFCW and pot management are not uniformly rosy. Belkin said that in Colorado, only about half of the owners he deals with are friendly. \u201cIt\u2019s a very entrepreneurial, bottom-line-driven industry in Colorado,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are some employers here that are vehemently anti-union.\u201d That\u2019s to be expected. Less expected, however, are the Obama administration\u2019s persistent raids, which are frustrating those relationships that have flourished between the industry and unions. The feds have also put the screws on employers\u2019 finances by, for instance, effectively blocking their access to business loans. \u201cThanks to [Obama], these guys don\u2019t even have bank accounts,\u201d Witemyre said. \u201cThey have to stack their cash in closets, and handle payroll with money orders.\u201d Now once-magnanimous managers, who a year ago provided perks like continuing education support and family health-care plans, are winnowing worker benefits. Hughes, the Local 5 cannabis rep, initially worried that by organizing weed workers, the UFCW is drawing a bull\u2019s-eye on particular dispensaries, teeing up DOJ raids on the very employees the union is trying to protect. (The DOJ did not return requests for comment.) Not every raid has targeted union shops, but the union\u2019s inability to protect their members in such situations has exposed the limits of the UFCW\u2019s political power\u2014which was a large part of their appeal to the industry in the first place.\n\nThe disillusionment is beginning to show. During last year's election, \u201cWe should have been out there knocking on doors,\" Witemyre said. \"But I couldn\u2019t pay [cannabis workers] to wear our \u2018UFCW for Obama\u2019 shirts.\"\n\nThe UFCW is counting on Rush, its cannabis division head, to keep this whole tenuous operation together. He had the idea to unionize weed workers, while he was working as a political organizer for the Local 5 in Oakland. At the time, late 2009, he was eight years sober, smoked only Lucky Strikes, and regarded the legalization movement at large as a bunch of jokers\u2014in short, the last guy anyone would have expected to arrange a pot-union marriage.\n\nBut Rush\u2019s personal history is suffuse with Oakland ties. He grew up in its middle-income Mosswood neighborhood, in a three-house complex that his family has owned since his great-great-grandfather constructed it about a century ago. Rush, who is lean, muscular, and looks a good deal older than his 52 years, still lives there today, together with his wife, his aunt, his mother-in-law, his three adult children, their mother, and the family\u2019s seven enormous dogs\u2014two American Pit Bull Terriers and five flame-colored Dogues des Bordeaux. As a boy, Rush and his grandmother would ride the bus a mile and a half to downtown Oakland to go shopping. It was an area that had been cored out by the crack epidemic in the \u201880s, only to be finally resurrected in the last decade or so. The state ballot initiative that would become Prop 19, which Rush read late one night while browsing for voter measures the UFCW might support, listed as its headquarters an address squarely in that neighborhood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt dawned on me what this revitalization in downtown Oakland had been about,\u201d he said. The medical marijuana industry\u2014which employs a mix of laid-off blue-collar workers, young college graduates, and refugees from the real estate industry\u2014had been the major driver in revivifying that neighborhood. The next morning, Rush rode his Harley Davidson, tricked out with Superman decals, to the campaign headquarters for Prop 19. He liked what he saw: a few campaign grinds clacking away on their laptops, surrounded by crusty pizza boxes, small mountains of cigarette butts, and cups of room-temperature coffee. \u201cAny campaign worth its salt, I don\u2019t care what time of the day or year it is, the bleary-eyed nerds are going to be there,\u201d he said. He learned that Prop 19, which would have legalized recreational pot use by adults in California, was funded and co-written by Lee, the owner of Oaksterdam. Within a few days, the two had made contact and arranged a kind of quid pro quo. The UFCW would endorse and assist Prop 19, and Oaksterdam\u2019s 100 instructors, nursery workers, and support staff would unionize.\n\nToday, Rush is the person directing the UFCW\u2019s organization of the marijuana industry. He is instrumental in building political coalitions to support the legalization cause, and he frequently jets between D.C., Oakland, and local unions around the country (when we met, in a sterile office in UFCW\u2019s K Street headquarters, he had recently returned from Massachusetts). While speaking, once he fixates on something, there is no interrupting him. \u201cHe\u2019s almost the epitome of a union guy,\u201d said Dale Sky Jones, the spokesperson for Prop 19. \u201cBig, bald, beefy.\u2026 His body language screams, \u2018Alright, I\u2019m here. Let\u2019s do this.\u2019\u201d\n\nBeginning with the campaign for Prop 19, Rush has also helped turn the legalization movement from a noisemaking campaign into a politically mature operation. Jones said that before Rush got involved, \u201cThe crucial conversations with opinion leaders and elected officials escaped us until the union walked us through the door.\u201d Rush helped her woo endorsements from big, conventional players, like the California chapter of the NAACP, whose president, Alice Huffman, is Rush\u2019s longtime friend. He also orchestrated for Jones more than a hundred private sessions in Sacramento with lawmakers, legislative aides, and lobbyists who had refused to take the movement seriously. These meetings were aimed at settling the concerns of Prop 19\u2019s natural enemies\u2014conservatives, law-enforcement lobbyists, prison-guard organizations\u2014before they were voiced publicly. \u201cWe were hounding them to be neutral,\u201d Jones recalled. \u201cJust don\u2019t talk. Don\u2019t come oppose us, don\u2019t go scare the grandmas and the soccer moms.\u201d One particularly cantankerous Republican, who began a conversation by asking Jones if he should roll up a towel and stick it under to door, came to agree by the end of the hour that Prop 19 was smart policy. While the politician\u2014whom Jones wouldn\u2019t name\u2014refused to take his opinion public, he also promised not to join the opposition.\n\nProp 19 failed to pass, earning 47.5 percent of the vote. But its big-name supporters, and the unusual quiet from groups expected to oppose it, helped make legalization a mainstream issue. Since then, Rush also encouraged local unions to join the crazy quilt of groups that assemble to support pot-friendly campaigns. In the 2011 fight over a proposed voter ban on medical marijuana dispensaries in Fort Collins, Colorado, Local 7 delivered eight full-time staff members and 40 volunteers to knock on doors for four weekends in a row, and about 50 members to make phone calls. The ban passed, but one year later, the UFCW helped undo it. This summer, while Colorado voters weighed Amendment 64, a ballot measure to legalize adult recreational pot use, the UFCW had anywhere from 100 to 1,000 precinct walkers knocking on doors at any given time, and volunteers who made hundreds of thousands of calls. The list goes on: In Denver, when the pot industry was divided over a ban on marijuana advertising within the city limits, the union sided with business owners who worried that sign spinners and crowded billboard ads cheapened the industry; the ban passed in August. In California, AB 2312, a bill to tax and regulate marijuana that passed the state assembly before recently getting stuck in the Senate, was drafted using language from UFCW. California will soon announce an apprenticeship program designed with the UFCW to train and certify marijuana industry workers. The UFCW has also provided the resources expected of a regular workplace union: When Oaksterdam was raided, said Jones, who was an executive there, the UFCW dipped into an emergency fund to provide workers with some lost wages and tuition relief.\n\nAs much progress as Rush and the UFCW have made on the state level, it will remain one step forward, two steps back as long as the Obama administration continues its haphazard crackdown on locally legal pot businesses. It is not likely, for example, that the National Labor Relations Board could even mediate a dispute between workers in pot retail and their managers, given that their jobs are federally illegal. For now, Rush is pinning his hopes on the upcoming Leahy hearing, a rare opportunity to impress upon Hill lawmakers the damage raids are doing to the lives of ordinary workers. But Rush is neither clear about how to make this happen, nor assured that he can. \u201cMy fear is the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings will happen, and we\u2019ll hear from the police, and the nurses, the doctors, the firefighters, the patients,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the workers won\u2019t get heard.\u201d", "topic": "Marijuana Legalization", "politicalLabel": "Conservative", "organization": "New Republic", "biasLabel": "Biased", "title": "Marijuana Legalization Draws Unions, And the DOJ Too", "yellowLabel": "Not Yellow", "tags": "set(['Economics', 'department of justice', 'pot', 'Home News', 'The Plank', 'marijuana', 'Labor', 'Culture', 'unions', 'Books', 'Events', 'Identity', 'politics', 'World', 'Technology', 'Politics', 'Film', 'Economy'])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
