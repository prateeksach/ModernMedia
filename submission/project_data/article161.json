The Department of Homeland Security will sustain \u201cirreparable harm\u201d if a stay is not granted, the Justice Department said. The judge, Andrew Hanen of United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, last week halted the immigration actions, which would grant temporary relief from deportation for 4.7 million people who are in the United States illegally. Officials also appealed Monday to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans.", "topic": "Immigration", "politicalLabel": "Neutral", "organization": "New York Times", "biasLabel": "Not Biased", "title": "U.S. Asks Judge to Lift His Block on Obama\u2019s Immigration Actions", "yellowLabel": "Not Yellow", "tags": "set([])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
