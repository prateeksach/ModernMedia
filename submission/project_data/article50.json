{"content": "Forty years ago, the United States locked up fewer than 200 of every 100,000 Americans. Then President Nixon declared war on drugs. Now we lock up more of our people than any other country -- more even than the authoritarian regimes in Russia and China.\n\nA war on drugs -- on people, that is -- is unworthy of a country that claims to be free.\n\nADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT\n\nUnfortunately, this outrage probably won\u2019t be discussed in Tampa or Charlotte.\n\nThe media (including Fox News) run frightening stories about Mexican cocaine cartels and marijuana gangs. Few of my colleagues stop to think that this is a consequence of the war and that decriminalization would end the violence. There are no wine \u201ccartels\u201d or beer \u201cgangs.\u201d No one \u201csmuggles\u201d liquor. Liquor dealers are called \u201cbusinesses,\u201d not gangs, and they \u201cship\u201d products instead of \u201csmuggling\u201d them. They settle disputes with lawyers rather than with guns.\n\nEverything can be abused, but that doesn\u2019t mean government can stop it. Government runs amok when it tries to protect us from ourselves.\n\n\u201cOur discomfort with the idea of heroin available at drugstores is similar to that of a Prohibitionist shuddering at the thought of bourbon at the corner store. We\u2019ll get over it.\u201d - John McWhorter\n\nDrug-related crime occurs because the drugs are available only through the artificially expensive black market. Drug users steal not because drugs drive them to steal. Our government says heroin and nicotine are similarly addictive, but no one robs convenience stores to get Marlboros. (That could change with confiscatory tobacco taxes.)\n\nAre defenders of the drug war aware of the consequences? I don\u2019t think so.\n\nJohn McWhorter, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, indicts the drug war for \u201cdestroying black America.\u201d McWhorter, by the way, is black.\n\nMcWhorter sees prohibition as the saboteur of black families. \u201cEnduring prison time is seen as a badge of strength. It\u2019s regarded (with some justification) as an unjust punishment for selling people something they want. The ex-con is a hero rather than someone who went the wrong way.\u201d\n\nHe enumerates the positive results from ending prohibition. \u201cNo more gang wars over turf, no more kids shooting each other. ... Men get jobs, as they did in the old days, even in the worst ghettos, because they have to.\u201d\n\nWould cheaper and freely available drugs bring their own catastrophe? \u201cOur discomfort with the idea of heroin available at drugstores is similar to that of a Prohibitionist shuddering at the thought of bourbon at the corner store. We\u2019ll get over it.\u201d\n\nThe media tell us that some drugs are so powerful that one \u201chit\u201d or \u201csnort\u201d will hook the user forever. But the government\u2019s own statistics disprove that. The National Institutes of Health found that 36 million Americans have tried crack. But only 12 percent have used it in the previous year, and fewer than six percent have used it in the previous month. If crack is so addictive, how did 88 percent of the users quit?\n\nIf drugs were legal, I suppose that at first more people would try them. But most would give them up. Eventually, drug use would diminish, as it has in Portugal, which decriminalized all drugs, and the Netherlands, which allows legal marijuana. More young men would find real jobs; police could focus on real crime.\n\nAs I write in \u201cNo, They Can\u2019t: Why Government Fails -- but Individuals Succeed\u201d when the public is this divided about an issue, it\u2019s best left to voluntary social pressure instead of legal enforcement. That\u2019s how most Americans decide whether to drink alcohol or go to church every week. Private voluntary social networks have their own ways of punishing bad behavior and send more nuanced messages about what\u2019s unacceptable. Government\u2019s one-size-fits-all rules don\u2019t improve on that.\n\n\u201cOnce the principle is admitted that it is the duty of the government to protect the individual against his own foolishness,\u201d economist Ludwig von Mises wrote, \u201cwhy not prevent him from reading bad books and bad plays?... The mischief done by bad ideologies is more pernicious ... than that done by narcotic drugs.\u201d\n\nIf we as adults own our own bodies, we ought to get to control what we put in them. It\u2019s legitimate for government to protect me from reckless drivers and drunken airline pilots -- but not to protect me from myself.\n\nJohn Stossel is the host of \"Stossel\" (Thursdays at 9 PM/ET), a weekly program highlighting current consumer issues with a libertarian viewpoint.
