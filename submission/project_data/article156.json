{"content": "Story highlights Democrats vent frustrations over Obamacare to White House officials at weekly caucus meeting\n\nCalifornia says more than 1 million people get insurance cancellation notices\n\nWhite House officials will go to Capitol on Thursday to meet with Senate Democrats\n\nHouse to vote on Friday on proposal that would let people keep their health care plans\n\nA private meeting on Capitol Hill with House Democrats and White House officials on Wednesday became heated when rank-and-file members expressed frustration about continued Obamacare problems, according to multiple sources in the room.\n\nOne congressional Democrat who attended the meeting said senior Obama administration officials Mike Hash and David Simas really \"got hit\" by House Democrats about everything from the troubled website to the broken presidential promise that people can keep the insurance plans they like.\n\nThe most pressing political challenge for House Democrats will come this Friday when they will have to vote on a House Republican plan by Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan that allows people to keep their policies if they want to.\n\nInsurance companies have begun canceling certain individual plans mainly due to Obamacare, creating an unexpected hardship for many who could soon find themselves without coverage or wind up facing higher costs for new plans they may not want.\n\nJust Watched Crossfire: Sanchez & Lankford agree replay More Videos ...

Insurers have, in a large number of cases, temporarily extended the time frame for ending those agreements.\n\nSeveral lawmakers -- even liberals who adamantly support Obamacare -- stood and warned the officials that the White House must come up with a solution before the vote.\n\nAs CNN first reported on Tuesday, many House Democrats are feeling so much pressure from constituents on this issue that they may feel compelled to vote yes for political reasons.\n\n\"Members want to keep their promises to their constituents, which is that they would have affordable insurance -- if they want to keep the plan they have -- they would keep it,\" said Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio. \"We would offer broader insurance alternatives so that people would have more competitive pricing.\"\n\nDemocratic congressional sources have told CNN that Friday is a de facto deadline for the administration to come up with a fix.\n\nThe preference would be an administrative remedy that circumvents the polarized Congress. But if that is not possible, Democrats are demanding the White House offer a legislative solution that they can offer as an alternative to the GOP plan.\n\nAdministration officials came to the meeting to try to convince House Democrats not to vote for the Upton bill, saying it would gum up the system and result in higher premiums for most Americans, sources told CNN.\n\n\"They were talking about the ultimate impact of voting for it. That, in fact, it would allow plans that had high deductibles, very poor coverage -- which of course we want to get rid of,\" said Jan Schakowsky, D-Illinois.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Jose Serrano of New York told reporters he thinks something will \"develop over the next 24 hours.\"\n\nWhite House spokesman Jay Carney said \"you can expect\" the Obama administration to announce plans for addressing health policy cancellations under Obamacare \"sooner rather than later.\"\n\nCarney said President Barack Obama has asked \"his team\" to come up with policy options, suggesting they were moving quickly.\n\nHe again rejected the Upton bill as \"not an effective fix\" because it opens up the plans to anyone, not just the people who's plans are being canceled.\n\nLawmakers also expressed frustration with the HealthCare.gov website, the chief portal for people who want to sign up for Obamacare through the federal government. It's October 1 launch was a debacle and the administration is scrambling to get it running up to speed.\n\nWhite House tech expert says healthcare.gov getting better\n\nSource: Nov. deadline possible\n\nRep. Anna Eschoo of California asked administration officials to stop using \"red lines\" they may have to cross and make the public relations problems worse for Democrats.\n\nJust Watched HealthCare.gov: How bad is it? replay More Videos ...

This is a primary reason why insurance companies are dropping existing coverage.\n\nCancellations drive concern\n\nAlthough the rocky rollout of the Obamacare website and low enrollment figures through Wednesday -- just over 100,000 -- are embarrassments for the President and Democrats in Congress who rammed through the health law in 2010 without Republican support, it is the policy cancellations that are really driving Democrats to put more pressure the White House.\n\nObama has apologized to those losing their coverage despite his assurances to the contrary and appears to be taking a hit for his Obamacare woes, according to the latest polling.\n\nHis approval rating among American voters has dropped to its lowest number in Quinnipiac University polling since he became President with new doubts being raised about trust.\n\nPressure to come up with a fix\n\nRep. Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 Democrat in the House, told reporters on Tuesday that Obama needs to come up with a solution \"sooner rather than later.\"\n\nNew York Rep. Steve Israel, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, criticized the House GOP plan, saying he believed it would increase premiums and remove consumer protections.\n\n\"We should do something so long as it actually fixes the problem and doesn't make the problem worse.\" Israel told reporters Tuesday, saying it would be helpful if the White House came out with a proposal before Friday's House vote.\n\nBut Rep. John Larsen of Connecticut, a loyal liberal and former House Democratic leader, said he hasn't seen details of the House GOP bill, but said he thought it could \"make sense\" and that there \"could be support\" depending on the approach.\n\nHoyer said earlier he hadn't ruled out being open to Upton's bill, but his spokeswoman says he's now opposed since Upton has said he won't make changes and Democratic leaders will likely urge their caucus to vote against it.\n\nMore pressure on Obama\n\nBoosting pressure further on Obama was former President Bill Clinton, who said on Tuesday that the President should find a way to uphold his initial promises about health policies.\n\nClinton: Obama should 'honor commitment' on keeping health plans\n\nA growing number of Democrats have called for changes or delays to the program as many face tough reelection bids in 2014 and are feeling pressure from challengers and constituents.\n\nObamacare rattling Democratic nerves\n\nAlthough he didn't go nearly as far as Clinton, Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Illinois, said he is open to changes as well and noted that Obama should have been more careful with his words in the first place.\n\nSen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, introduced a narrower bill than what House Republicans are planning with Upton's plan and said that she has growing support in the Senate, including Dianne Feinstein, Joe Manchin, Mark Pryor and Kay Hagan -- all Democrats.\n\nShe noted her proposal would allow people who have individual insurance, which she says makes up about 5% of the market, to keep their coverage. Insurers would have to notify those customers what minimum coverage requirements are not being met.\n\nA Senate Democratic leadership aide told CNN that White House officials will go to Capitol Hill on Thursday to meet with Senate Democrats about looking for a fix.\n\nObamacare promises: Where things stand\n\nOfficial: Hackers tried repeatedly to attack Obamacare website\n\nMany in Congress avoiding Obamacare exchanges", "topic": "Obamacare", "politicalLabel": "Conservative", "organization": "CNN", "biasLabel": "Not Biased", "title": "White House officials get earful from Democrats on Obamacare", "yellowLabel": "Not Yellow", "tags": "set([])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
