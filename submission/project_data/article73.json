But a psychiatrist who was honored last year by the White House and serves as an advisor to a prominent anti-marijuana group seized instead on the full results of the toxicology report to argue there is another contributing cause of Brown\u2019s death: marijuana.\n\nIn a blog post that was publicized on the Facebook page of Smart Approaches to Marijuana (Project SAM) and deleted only after a Twitter backlash, Dr. Christian Thurstone argues that because the toxicology report confirms the presence of marijuana above the legal impairment limit, \u201cBrown\u2019s death also should serve as a tragic reminder that marijuana is not harmless, that it is not just like alcohol or \u2018safer than alcohol,\u2019 that its consumption often leads to impairment that is very difficult for the public to measure \u2014 also making it tough for the public to hold users accountable for the harm they\u2019ve caused others. Marijuana users also could be vulnerable to aggression and attacks while under the drug\u2019s influence.\u201d\n\nProject SAM is perhaps the most prominent anti-marijuana organization. It takes a moderate position in the scheme of anti-drug organizations that calls for \u201ca middle road between incarceration and legalization,\u201d as compared to more fringe groups like Save Our Society From Drugs. But it has been at the forefront of opposing legalization initiatives, and even a federal initiative to protect medical marijuana distributors that are legal under state law, with former Rhode Island Congressman Patrick Kennedy (D) as its spokesperson. It states that its members \u201cbelieve in an approach that neither legalizes, nor demonizes, marijuana,\u201d which is probably why, hours after promoting Thurstone\u2019s post, the organization took it down, as its leader Kevin Sabet said only on Twitter:\n\nWe deleted the controversial posting, but many people still retweeting to spread the misinformation. Wish I could say I was surprised. \u2014 Kevin Sabet (@KevinSabet) October 23, 2014\n\nNeither Sabet nor the organization made any further comments about the substance of the post, although he later tweeted:\n\nIt's incredible how marijuana advocates go for personal jabs rather than discuss substance. http://t.co/V1ReXiTczk \u2014 Kevin Sabet (@KevinSabet) October 23, 2014\n\nAfter the publication of this article, Sabet tweeted another statement overnight, stating, \u201cLet me be clear: to imply Michael Brown\u2019s death was due to pot is to confuse & distort a profoundly troubling event. This isn\u2019t SAM\u2019s view.\u201d\n\nThurstone is a science advisor to SAM, although the Michael Brown post now includes a disclaimer stating that the post represents his views alone and not \u201cthe views of any organizations with which he is affiliated.\u201d\n\nBut Thurstone has made himself something of a public figure in his own right. In 2013, he was named an \u201cAdvocate for Action\u201d by the White House\u2019s Office of National Drug Control Policy. In that role, he wrote blog posts published by on the ONDCP site.\n\nAnd in the media, he has made a campaign out of flagging the potential harm of marijuana on adolescents. Thurstone makes reasonable arguments that marijuana can be addictive in teens, and that use of marijuana among adolescents is increasing. But Thurstone does nothing in his latest post to explain the link between those claims, and his conclusion that Brown\u2019s death had anything to do with marijuana. In fact, he seems to say that pot could have made Brown more violent or less violent, but that either way, it must have done something.\n\nThinkProgress could not reach Thurstone via email or phone Thursday afternoon. But on Friday morning, ThinkProgress spoke with Thurstone\u2019s wife, Christine Tatum, who explained that Thurstone is deployed overseas and could not be reached, but that she assisted Thurstone with his post. \u201cHe\u2019s never said that marijuana use caused that boy\u2019s death,\u201d Tatum told ThinkProgress. She said Thurstone is just \u201cstating facts\u201d and that \u201che\u2019s just saying marijuana\u2019s not harmless. \u2026 He is just pointing out that marijuana use can have consequences.\u201d\n\nWhen asked to explain what Thurstone meant when he said that Brown\u2019s death served as a \u201ctragic reminder that marijuana is not harmless,\u201d she said, \u201cYou either could be harmed while you are under the influence or you could face consequences because you have harmed someone else while you are under the influence. It could happen to you.\u201d She later added in a subsequent email, \u201cHis death \u2014 which is the only reason we\u2019re all seeing his subsequent tox screen \u2014 is a tragic reminder that marijuana use can be addictive and that the drug can be abused.\u201d\n\nThurstone\u2019s argument glosses over the clear racial components of Brown\u2019s death, and bolsters the character assassination that has become common in cases where young black teens have been killed. Trayvon Martin, Renisha McBride, Sean Bell, and several other young black victims have been blamed for alleged use of marijuana or alcohol before their deaths, even though it has nothing to do with whether they should have died.\n\nTom Angell of the pro-legalization group Marijuana Majority called SAM\u2019s promotion of Thurstone\u2019s comments a sign of \u201cdesperation,\u201d saying in a statement to ThinkProgress, \u201cKevin Sabet and Project SAM have made a concerted effort to reach out to people of color in an effort to defend prohibition despite the clear racially disproportionate impact of its enforcement. I don\u2019t think these offensive comments about Michael Brown are going to aid that effort.\u201d\n\nAlso Thursday, the Washington, D.C. branches of the NAACP and National Organization of Women endorsed Washington\u2019s ballot initiative to legalize marijuana. Local NAACP chapters also supported the initiatives in Colorado, Washington, and Oregon. And the national chapter endorsed a federal marijuana reform bill.", "topic": "Marijuana Legalization", "politicalLabel": "Neutral", "organization": "ThinkProgress", "biasLabel": "Not Biased", "title": "Leading Opponent of Marijuana Legalization Suggests Pot Contributed to Michael Brown\u2019s Death", "yellowLabel": "Not Yellow", "tags": "set(['CRIMINAL JUSTICE', 'NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION', 'IMMIGRATION', 'POLICE BRUTALITY', 'Marijuana', 'Criminal Justice', 'War on Drugs', 'CALIFORNIA', 'Ferguson'])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
