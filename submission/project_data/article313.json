{"content": "Forty years ago today, New York became the first state in the US where abortion was broadly legal. Since then, New York City has become the nation\u2019s undisputed abortion capital, with an overwhelmingly pro-choice political establishment \u2014 and an abortion rate that\u2019s three times the national average.\n\nAnd a stifling taboo on the subject that chokes off any mature discussion about what such a rate means for the public welfare.\n\nAccording to the city Health Department, 2008 saw 89,469 abortions performed in New York City \u2014 seven for every 10 live births. Among black women, abortions out number live births by three to two.\n\nIn other words, the reality in New York is about as far as possible from Bill Clinton\u2019s proposition that abortion should be \u201csafe, legal and rare.\u201d\n\nYet, of the 51 City Council members, only five \u2014 Republicans Eric Ulrich and Dan Halloran and Democrats Peter Vallone Jr., James Sanders and Danny Dromm, all of Queens \u2014 were willing to call that abortion rate \u201ctoo high.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think those numbers are meaningful,\u201d said Upper East Side Councilwoman Jessica Lappin. \u201cI don\u2019t tell people whether they should have two kids, four kids or 10 kids.\u201d One council aide even fretted that a lower abortion rate would bankrupt the city.\n\nSpeaker Christine Quinn refused to answer at all, offering only the canned response that \u201cwe can reduce the number of unintended pregnancies . . . by expanding access to contraceptives and increasing sex education.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, one dissenter from New York\u2019s abortion taboo is former state Sen. Franz Leichter \u2014 who sponsored the legalization bill when he was in the Assembly in 1970. The abortion rate \u201cis higher than anyone wanted to see,\u201d he says \u2014 and \u201cmy support for abortion rights . . . is as strong as anyone\u2019s.\u201d\n\nWhy the silence? Perhaps it\u2019s a concern that New York\u2019s pro-choice majority is not as solid as it seems, and that talking candidly about the issue will only make matters worse.\n\nIf opinion research reveals anything about Americans\u2019 attitudes toward abortion, it\u2019s that they don\u2019t like to think about it \u2014 period.\n\nPoll respondents show an uncanny ability to affirm contradictory ideas at the same time. Gallup finds that a slight majority of Americans oppose the overturning of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Roe v. Wade \u2014 yet majorities also think abortion should be illegal under some circumstances even in the first trimester, which the Roe framework forbids.\n\nIndeed, a fundamental aversion to abortion can be seen in the fact that the more specific poll questions get, the more pro-life Americans appear, at least in comparison to present law.\n\nIt\u2019s probably no coincidence that 2009 was the first time in decades that more Americans identified as pro-life than as pro-choice \u2014 and also the year that the ObamaCare debate nudged abortion to the front of the national discussion.\n\nEven in pro-choice New York, a similar pattern holds: A 2005 Quinnipiac survey found that 70 percent of state voters favored toughening the state\u2019s abortion law with a parental-notification requirement, and 64 percent backed mandatory waiting periods. Open discussion about the actual oc currence of abortion would only push those numbers higher.\n\nWhatever the reasons for it, New York\u2019s abortion taboo plainly cripples the city\u2019s ability to deal maturely with some of its most pressing social problems.\n\nTake absentee fathers \u2014 one of the strongest predictors of poverty and the plight of some one-third of city children.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to deny that the act of abortion \u2014 essentially, the violent destruction of a developing member of the next generation \u2014 makes a cultural mark, especially when practiced to the extent it is in New York. (Councilman Sanders, though pro-choice, argues that it marks an \u201cirresponsible\u201d attitude toward family formation.)\n\nThus, an honest discussion would at least entertain the possibility that the easy availability of subsidized abortion weakens the cultural expectation that young men must take responsibility for their offspring.\n\nInstead, New York\u2019s response to the problem of absentee fathers consists entirely of nanny-state facelifts \u2014 i.e., Mayor Bloomberg\u2019s just-announced position of Fatherhood Services Coordinator, or \u201cDaddy Czar.\u201d\n\nJust as weak is Speaker Quinn\u2019s breezy insistence that more access to contraception is a silver bullet for the problems surrounding abortion.\n\nSet aside the fact that the abortion rate is much lower in plenty of places that don\u2019t advertise free condoms on public transportation, as the Department of Health does. Given that Quinn is presumably comfortable with Gotham\u2019s present abortion rate, why should New Yorkers think there\u2019s any urgency to that project?\n\nNew York needs a frank discussion about the consequences of 40 years of legal abortion. Here\u2019s hoping its doesn\u2019t take another 40 for that to happen.\n\njwilson@nypost.com\n\n", "topic": "Abortion", "politicalLabel": "Neutral", "organization": "New York Post", "biasLabel": "Biased", "title": "Where New York\u2019s not proud to lead", "yellowLabel": "Not Yellow", "tags": "set(['Game of Thrones', 'Hillary Clinton', 'the masters', 'Chess', 'New York Yankees', 'NYPD'])", "opinionLabel": "Opinion Article"}
