If you have a bushmaster, first of all, why would you have one? PRATT: President Reagan owned an AR-15. MITCHELL: And he supported gun control. He advocated\u2026 PRATT: In his later years. We have to keep that in account. MITCHELL: In his later years he was almost killed by John Hinckley. PRATT: But all through his presidency he opposed gun control, that\u2019s my point.\n\nWatch it:\n\nReagan supported gun safety measures throughout his political career. In 1986, he signed into law the Firearm Owners Protection Act, which \u201cbanned ownership of any fully automatic rifles that were not already registered on the day the law was signed.\u201d He later backed the Brady bill, expressing support for \u201ca seven-day waiting period before a purchaser could take possession of a handgun, an even more stringent restriction than the five day cooling-off period that was included in the final legislation, and less stringent than the 15-day cooling-off period he signed into law as governor of California.\u201d", "topic": "Gun Control", "politicalLabel": "Liberal", "organization": "ThinkProgress", "biasLabel": "Biased", "title": "Reagan Only Supported Gun Control Because He Was Senile, Prominent Gun Advocate Suggests", "yellowLabel": "Yellow", "tags": "set(['NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION', 'IMMIGRATION', 'POLICE BRUTALITY', 'Guns', 'CRIMINAL JUSTICE', 'CALIFORNIA', 'Ronald Reagan'])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
