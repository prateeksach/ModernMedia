{"content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists says Earth is now closer to human-caused doomsday than it has been in more than 30 years because of global warming and nuclear weaponry. But other experts say that\u2019s way too gloomy.\n\nThe advocacy group founded by the creators of the atomic bomb moved their famed \u201cDoomsday Clock\u201d ahead two minutes on Thursday. It said the world is now three minutes from a catastrophic midnight, instead of five minutes.\n\n\u201cThis is about doomsday; this is about the end of civilization as we know it,\u201d bulletin executive director Kennette Benedict said at a news conference in Washington.\n\nShe called both climate change and modernization of nuclear weaponry equal but undeniable threats to humanity\u2019s continued existence that triggered the 20 scientists on the board to decide to move the clock closer to midnight.\n\n\u201cThe probability of global catastrophe is very high, and the actions needed to reduce the risks of disaster must be taken very soon,\u201d Benedict said.\n\nBut other scientists aren\u2019t quite so pessimistic.\n\nMichael Oppenheimer, a professor of both geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University, said in an email: \u201cI suspect that humans will \u2018muddle through\u2019 the climate situation much as we have muddled through the nuclear weapons situation \u2014 limiting the risk with cooperative international action and parallel domestic policies.\u201d\n\nThe bulletin has included climate change in its doomsday clock since 2007.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the Doomsday clock-setters changed their definition of \u2018doomsday\u2019 shows how profoundly the world has changed \u2014 they have to find a new source of doom because global thermonuclear war is now so unlikely,\u201d Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker wrote in an email. Pinker in his book \u201cThe Better Angels of our Nature\u201d uses statistics to argue that the world has become less war-like, less violent and more tolerant in recent decades and centuries.\n\nRichard Somerville, a member of the Bulletin\u2019s board who is a climate scientist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, said the trend in heat-trapping emissions from the burning of fossil fuels will \u201clead to major climatic disruption globally. The urgency has nothing to do with politics or ideology. It arises from the laws of physics and biology and chemistry. These laws are non-negotiable.\u201d\n\nBut Somerville agreed that the threat from climate change isn\u2019t quite as all-or-nothing as it is with nuclear war.\n\nEven with the end of the cold war, the lack of progress in the dismantling of nuclear weapons and countries like the United States and Russia spending hundreds of billions of dollars on modernizing nuclear weaponry makes an atomic bomb explosion \u2014 either accidental or on purpose \u2014 a continuing and more urgent threat, Benedict said.\n\nBut Benedict did acknowledge the group has been warning of imminent nuclear disaster with its clock since 1947 and it hasn\u2019t happened yet.", "topic": "Climate Change", "politicalLabel": "Liberal", "organization": "New York Post", "biasLabel": "Not Biased", "title": "Atomic scientists: We\u2019re 2 minutes closer to doomsday", "yellowLabel": "Yellow", "tags": "set(['Doomsday', 'Climate Change', 'Nuclear Weapons', 'Science'])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
