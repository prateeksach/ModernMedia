{"content": "As mothers tend to do, Britt Sady loves her child Noah. He\u2019s 3 years old and recently to his delight she taught him the word \u201cfart.\u201d That Noah has Down syndrome hasn\u2019t diminished Britt\u2019s love.\n\nBut won\u2019t he become increasingly a source of frustration and even disappointment? Isn\u2019t raising a Down syndrome (DS) child supposed to be a nightmare? Sady asked a friend raising a 14-year-old son with DS, \u201cWhen does it get hard?\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cIf you don\u2019t care too much what other people think, and you don\u2019t live too far into the future . . . it\u2019s all easy.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t care too much about what other people think. That really says a lot about why, according to one estimate, 92% of expectant mothers who obtain a certain DS diagnosis choose to abort.\n\nChildren are a status symbol that we love to boast about, and we fear that raising a DS child lowers our status, makes us pitiable.\n\nBut is embarrassment a good enough reason to extinguish a life?\n\nThis week the state of North Dakota passed a law making it illegal to abort a child because of expected birth defects, or because the parents want a child of a different gender.\n\nThe new law seems certain to be struck down by the courts, not that the state could keep its residents from going elsewhere for an abortion. (There is only one abortion clinic in the state anyway). Forty years after Roe v. Wade, it\u2019s almost impossible to imagine major restrictions on abortion standing up to judicial scrutiny in any state.\n\nBut the absence of a legal issue doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s no moral one.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to bring a child in the world only to see her suffer,\u201d we say.\n\nBut \u201cthese children are not suffering,\u201d says Stacy Calcano, an Inwood mother of four including a boy with DS. \u201cI have yet to see or meet a person with Down syndrome that I would categorize as suffering.\u201d\n\nWhen Calcano learned of her son Carter\u2019s condition when she was pregnant with him, she at first couldn\u2019t speak and had to ask her ob-gyn to call back. Doctors and nurses repeatedly told her, \u201cWe have to expedite these results because you only have three weeks.\u201d\n\nThree weeks for what? Calcano and her husband wanted to go ahead with the pregnancy. \u201cThe diagnosis didn\u2019t change the fact that he was my son,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m a believer in choice. But I had children and I became a parent because I wanted to be a parent. Not because I had preconceived ideas of what my children would accomplish. Anytime you have a child you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to end up with.\u201d\n\nA DS child is not \u201can empty vessel,\u201d she says. \u201cWe now know that these kids can do anything that typically developing kids can do. It just takes a little more work on the front end.\u201d\n\nIn a survey published in the American Journal of Medical Genetics, 99% of DS people said they were generally happy.\n\nBritt Sady, Noah\u2019s mom, is the executive director of the New York outpost of GiGi\u2019s Playhouse, a Chicago-based community center for DS kids (mostly under age 6) that opened a year ago to teach basic skills like climbing steps and table manners.\n\nThe space on West 117th Street, which is almost entirely staffed by volunteers like Calcano, serves more than 100 DS kids, who make friends with DS peers but are also encouraged to interact with non-DS siblings and grownups. There are also seminars for parents. All programs are free (though donations are welcome). The center has been such a success that it\u2019s looking to expand to a larger space.\n\nDS children are mentally disabled, but with early training many are able to attend school in the same classrooms as non-DS kids. Many go on to successfully hold adult jobs and live independently. Life expectancy has risen from about 12 to almost 60 since mid-century.\n\nMostly the \u201csuffering\u201d we want to prevent is our own, as parents. DS children generally won\u2019t be trophies in the competitive parenting game that starts with training for that \u201cgifted and talented\u201d test at age four and leads to the Ivy League, the cool career and world domination.\n\nSays Calcano, \u201cThere are some people who just can\u2019t move ahead with the pregnancy knowing that their children face limitations. Most children with Down syndrome are not going to become doctors. They\u2019re not going to be lawyers. Our kids will be limited in what they can accomplish in life.\u201d\n\nIs there anything Calcano wishes she had done differently? Yes. \u201cFor me,\u201d she says, \u201cthe moment Carter was born my biggest regret was all the time I wasted on worrying about the \u2018what if\u2019s.\u2019 \u201d", "topic": "Abortion", "politicalLabel": "Neutral", "organization": "New York Post", "biasLabel": "Biased", "title": "The gifts we\u2019d lose", "yellowLabel": "Not Yellow", "tags": "set(['Game of Thrones', 'Hillary Clinton', 'the masters', 'Chess', 'New York Yankees', 'NYPD'])", "opinionLabel": "Opinion Article"}
