{"content": "Story highlights Voters in Oregon, Alaska and Washington, D.C. approved marijuana legalization on Tuesday\n\nThe Oregon and Alaska measures legalizes personal possession, manufacture and sale of marijuana for people 21 years of age and older\n\nFlorida voters rejected a proposal on medical marijuana in Florida, according to a CNN projection\n\nBecause the law was a constitutional amendment, it needed 60% approval\n\nVoters in Oregon, Alaska and Washington, D.C. have voted to approve sweeping pro-marijuana legalization, according to a CNN projections.\n\nThe three wins have pro-legalization activists enthused and many are already looking towards 2016, when ballot initiatives in states such as California, Massachusetts, Maine, Nevada and Arizona are likely to be put to voters.\n\nIn Oregon, the law legalizes personal possession, manufacture and sale of marijuana for people 21 years of age and older. Mimicking similar plans in Washington State and Colorado, the Oregon law will also create a commercial regulatory system for the production, distribution and sale of marijuana.\n\nAlaska's law is similar to Oregon and would tax and regulate the production, sale and use of marijuana, making the use legal for people over 21 years old\n\nWashington, D.C.'s proposal, while scaled back compared to the others, allows for a person over 21 years old to posses up to two ounces of marijuana for personal use and grow up to six cannabis plants in their home. It also allows people to transfer up to one ounce of marijuana to another person, but not sell it.\n\nThe issue is not fully resolved for the District of Columbia, however. Because of its unique status as a district, not a state, Congress has the authority to overrule D.C. laws and some lawmakers have signaled that they would likely work to overrule the popular vote.\n\nHistory of marijuana in America 40 photos History of marijuana in America 40 photos Public perceptions about pot have come a long way, from the dire warnings of \"Reefer Madness\" to growing acceptance of medical marijuana and the legalization of recreational use.

Only 57% of voters voted yes, compared to 43% who voted no with 91% of vote reporting.\n\nMarijuana has been a surging issue of late.\n\nIn 2013, according to Gallup, more Americans supported legalization than those who opposed it. Just 14 years earlier, those who opposed it had over a 2-to-1 advantage. A 2014 Pew Research poll found that 54% of Americans supported making marijuana legal.\n\nEver since voters in Colorado and Washington allowed the sale of legalized marijuana in 2014 (after voters decided to legalize years before), the push for more marijuana legalization has become a popular nationwide effort.\n\nThe laws in Oregon and Alaska are similar to what Colorado and Washington State passed and would allow recreational sale and taxation of the drug.
