{"content": "Support for stricter gun laws hasn\u2019t jumped as fast or as far in recent weeks as many liberals had hoped and expected. If you\u2019re wondering why, maybe the reason is the shakiness of the public\u2019s trust in government itself.\n\nAfter the horrific murders three weeks ago at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, gun-control advocates confidently predicted that a wave of revulsion would sweep the nation. We would, in the popular argot, \u201chit the reset button,\u201d beginning a fresh debate on new terms.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t happened that way. In the USA Today-Gallup Poll taken just a week after the shooting, when one would expect the largest emotional effect, support for \u201cmore strict\u201d gun control in the abstract was at 58%, compared with 43% about a year earlier. On specifics, 51% opposed a ban on private ownership of assault weapons. (There\u2019s more support for posting armed guards in schools than for limiting access to assault weapons.)\n\nIf Newtown hasn\u2019t pushed the numbers much, why not?\n\nOne plausible explanation is a lack of trust in the people who would be doing the regulating. The Gallup Organization has been measuring Americans\u2019 trust in their government since 1997. Last year, only half of Americans said they generally trust the federal government to do the right thing on domestic policy \u2014 a significant improvement over the 43% figure a year earlier, but nowhere near the heights of trust one saw in President Bill Clinton\u2019s second term and President George W. Bush\u2019s first.\n\n\u201cTrust us, we\u2019ll protect you,\u201d isn\u2019t a very persuasive case to make to the tens of millions of Americans who have guns in their homes. And directing fury at gun owners for their lack of trust isn\u2019t likely to increase their faith in government.\n\nBloomberg View", "topic": "Gun Control", "politicalLabel": "Neutral", "organization": "New York Post", "biasLabel": "Not Biased", "title": "Why push for gun control has stalled", "yellowLabel": "Not Yellow", "tags": "set(['Game of Thrones', 'Hillary Clinton', 'the masters', 'Chess', 'New York Yankees', 'NYPD'])", "opinionLabel": "Opinion Article"}
