{"content": "Six Groups of Americans And How They Are Faring\n\nEach symbol = one million people\n\nEnrollments Participation in Obamacare\n\nGood riddance Estimated drops in inferior plans and the uninsured because of Obamacare\n\nOther insurance plans\n\n1. A HUGE DROP IN THE UNINSURED\n\nAt least 13.4 million Americans \u2014 more than the population of Illinois \u2014 have been added to the insurance rolls. Before the law, 42 million were uninsured; that number has fallen by almost 30 percent.\n\nNo longer uninsured: 13.4 MILLION\n\nStill uninsured: 28.9 MILLION\n\n2. MILLIONS USED THE EXCHANGES\n\n11.4 million people have signed up \u2014 stragglers will increase the final tally \u2014 to buy insurance on the exchanges. Perhaps 12 percent will drop out by not paying the first premium, so the ultimate number should be at least 10 million.\n\nNEW: 10 MILLION\n\n3. MILLIONS MORE BOUGHT DIRECTLY\n\nBetter insurance: The law requires all plans to meet minimum standards of coverage. Eight million Americans, signing up outside of the exchanges, will benefit in 2015 from upgraded plans.\n\nNEW: 8 MILLION\n\nPrevious: 0.5 million\n\nInferior plans: Most went away. After being told by the president that \u201cif you like the plan you have, you can keep it,\u201d approximately 7.5 million people left substandard plans, many of them involuntarily.\n\nPeople whose inferior plans ended: 7.5 MILLION\n\nPeople in inferior plans that must end by 2017: 3 MILLION\n\n4. HELP FOR LOW-INCOME HOUSEHOLDS\n\nA Medicaid expansion to raise the income threshold (up to $33,465 for a family of four) greatly reduced the number of uninsured. 22 predominantly Republican states have declined this expansion, so participation is below initial forecasts. But the number of states holding out has been dropping because of public pressure.\n\nNEW: 13.4 MILLION\n\nEXPANSION: 9.1\n\n\u201cWOODWORKERS\u201d: 3.3 MILLION (People who were already eligible for Medicaid and came out of the \u201cwoodwork\u201d because of the law.)\n\nBULK TRANSFERS: 1\n\nPrevious: 56 MILLION\n\n5. MEDICARE ENROLLMENTS UNTOUCHED\n\n50 million elderly Americans are covered by Medicare, so the law has no meaningful impact on those enrollments. A small increase stems from an aging population.\n\nPrevious: 49 MILLION\n\nNew: 1 MILLION\n\n6. A CHIP OFF EMPLOYER PLANS\n\nThe creation of the exchanges provides some encouragement for employers to drop coverage, particularly if their plans do not meet the tougher new standards. Over the next three years, that fall off is expected to grow to nine million, still small in relation to the 39 million projected to be added under the law.\n\nPeople whose employer plans ended: 1.5 MILLION\n\nPrevious: 150 MILLION", "topic": "Obamacare", "politicalLabel": "Liberal", "organization": "New York Times", "biasLabel": "Not Biased", "title": "For Tens of Millions, Obamacare Is Working", "yellowLabel": "Not Yellow", "tags": "set([])", "opinionLabel": "Opinion Article"}
