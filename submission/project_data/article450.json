Mike Pence (R-IN) defended a \u201creligious liberty\u201d law he signed on Sunday, saying that tolerance was a \u201ctwo-way street\u201d and the law was about protecting religious people from government overreach.\n\nPence had said he was going to appear on the Sunday news show to \u201cclarify the intent\u201d of the law. Instead, he refused repeatedly to say if the law would greenlight discrimination against people based on their sexual orientation in the state.\n\nPence told This Week host George Stephanopoulos it was \u201cabsolutely not\u201d a mistake to sign the religious liberty bill into law. Pence dodged a question about Advance America\u2019s statement, which said that bakers and florists might be allowed to refuse to serve a gay couple at their wedding. \u201cThis is not about discrimination. This is about empowering people to confront government overreach,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIs tolerance a two-way street or not? There\u2019s a lot of talk about tolerance in this country today having to do with people on the left. Here Indiana steps forward to protect the constitutional rights and privileges of freedom of religion for people of faith and families of faith in our state,\u201d Pence said.\n\n\n\nWorld News Videos | US News Videos\n\nPence, in an interview with the Indianapolis Star on Saturday, said \u201cwe are in discussions with legislative leaders this weekend to see if there\u2019s a way to clarify the intent of the law.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday evening, thousands protested against the law. Several businesses expressed their disapproval of the law, with at least two \u2014 Salesforce and Angie\u2019s List \u2014 saying they were going to halt expansion in the state or ban travel to the state.

Getting visibly frustrated when Stephanopoulos kept asking if he thought Pence believed the law made it legal to discriminate against gays and lesbians in the state. \u201cHooisers don\u2019t discriminate,\u201d Pence said.", "topic": "Gay Marriage", "politicalLabel": "Liberal", "organization": "ThinkProgress", "biasLabel": "Not Biased", "title": "Governor Becomes Frustrated When Asked If \u2018Religious Liberty\u2019 Law Will Be Used To Discriminate", "yellowLabel": "Not Yellow", "tags": "set(['SAME-SEX PARENTING', 'Mike Pence', 'FLORIDA', 'SUPREME COURT', 'NONDISCRIMINATION PROTECTIONS', 'Indiana', 'TRANSGENDER', 'Religious Liberty'])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
