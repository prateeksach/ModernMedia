{"content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Two Senate Republicans closed in on a deal regarding stronger border security on Wednesday evening with the bipartisan group of eight senators that drafted an overhaul of the nation\u2019s immigration laws, hoping to find a resolution to an issue that for two weeks has dominated \u2014 and at times bedeviled \u2014 the immigration debate on the Senate floor.\n\nThe agreement, if reached, would further strengthen border security provisions in the measure, with the goal of attracting more votes, especially from Republicans who are reluctant to support any immigration legislation that does include significant enforcement measures at the southern border.\n\nThe two Republican senators, Bob Corker of Tennessee and John Hoeven of North Dakota, have been working behind the scenes to come up with a provision that would appease hesitant Republicans and help garner broad bipartisan support for the bill. On Wednesday evening they said they were close.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a really good day,\u201d Mr. Corker said. \u201cI feel good about where we are.\u201d\n\nThe two senators briefed their Republican colleagues at a party lunch, and afterward said they were heartened by the positive response. Their push to strengthen border security, they said, was given a boost by a Congressional Budget Office report released Tuesday that found that the current bill \u2014 without any additional border security provisions \u2014 would decrease annual illegal immigration by only 25 percent.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the hell is going to happen,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, \u201cbut we\u2019re on the verge of doing something dramatic on the border, and if it happens it will be due to Hoeven and Corker and a lot of our colleagues.\u201d\n\nMr. Graham, a member of the bipartisan group that drafted the original legislation, served as the group\u2019s conduit to Mr. Corker and Mr. Hoeven to ensure that their provision was acceptable to both Democrats and Republicans.\n\nThe Corker-Hoeven proposal would be an alternative to an amendment introduced by Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas. Mr. Cornyn\u2019s plan would create strict goals that would need to be met before more than 11 million undocumented immigrants could start on the path to citizenship and attain legal status, including a 90 percent apprehension rate of illegal crossers at the southern border and a biometric exit system at all airports and seaports.\n\nDemocrats consider Mr. Cornyn\u2019s plan a \u201cpoison pill\u201d that is logistically hard to achieve and could indefinitely delay citizenship for those covered by the measure.\n\nOriginally, Mr. Corker and Mr. Hoeven were considering a provision that would have required a 90 percent effectiveness rate in apprehending or turning back illegal crossers, using a combination of conventional border infrastructure, like fencing and observation towers, and high-tech elements including heat-sensing cameras and drones.\n\n\u201cIt has to be measurable, objective metrics so we know the border is secure and so that folks feel that it\u2019s attainable and we can agree that we have a secure border,\u201d Mr. Hoeven said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to come up with something where we can get Republicans and Democrats to agree on.\u201d\n\nDemocrats, however, still objected to the 90 percent trigger linking border security to a pathway to citizenship, and on Wednesday, Mr. Corker said they had \u201ccome up with a solution.\u201d\n\nAccording to aides with knowledge of the discussions, the Republicans agreed to make the 90 percent figure a goal rather than a requirement, in exchange for a detailed border security plan that lays out serious assurances of both manpower and resources at the southern border.\n\n\u201cUnprecedented deployment of boots on the ground and commitment to the fence,\u201d explained an aide close to the talks, speaking anonymously to talk candidly about continuing private discussions. The aide added that the Corker-Hoeven provision would go even further in terms of adding border patrol agents than Mr. Cornyn\u2019s plan, which required an additional 5,000.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re talking about is basically a dramatic effort to secure the border that would just in most people\u2019s minds be substantial,\u201d Mr. Graham said, when asked how the group had managed to reach an agreement on the 90 percent figure.\n\nSenator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, who helped write the bill, called the day\u2019s talks \u201creally productive.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made a lot of progress in the last 24 hours,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we have some vetting to do with our respective allies.\u201d\n\nMr. Corker and Mr. Hoeven were still finalizing the plans for their provision Wednesday. They could introduce it separately, but they are also working to create a broader border security package of amendments that would include not only their proposal, but also those of other Republicans, including Senators Susan Collins of Maine, Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, and Rob Portman of Ohio\n\nIn addition to the Corker-Hoeven proposal and Mr. Cornyn\u2019s plan, several other Republicans are likely to offer border security measures of their own.\n\nSenator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, another of the bill\u2019s authors, is working on a plan that would allow Congress to write its own border security plan, rather than turning the responsibility over to the Department of Homeland Security. Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, is also considering a border enhancement provision.\n\nOn Wednesday, as senators worked through several other amendments to the bill, the Senate voted 61 to 37 to table a border security plan by Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky. Mr. Paul\u2019s amendment would have created a series of stricter border security requirements and required Congress to vote every year for five years that it believed the border was secure, before immigrants could continue on their path to legalization.\n\nThe Corker-Hoeven provision was expected to attract the support of 8 to 12 Republicans, according to some estimates.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to see how many people this brings to the table,\u201d Mr. Corker said. \u201cWe\u2019d like for it to go over to the House with momentum.\u201d", "topic": "Immigration", "politicalLabel": "Neutral", "organization": "New York Times", "biasLabel": "Not Biased", "title": "Two G.O.P.
