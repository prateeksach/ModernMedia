On the first say of the new legislative session, the Democratic majority that swept back into power last November quickly passed a similar ban again.\n\nRepublicans attacked the new ban as an encroachment of their Second Amendment rights, but according to the Concord-Monitor also sought to derail the bill by warning of a slippery slope:\n\n\u201cA holstered gun is not a deadly weapon. . . . But anything can be used as a deadly weapon. A credit card can be used to cut somebody\u2019s throat,\u201d said Rep. Dan Dumaine, an Auburn Republican.\n\nNew Hampshire Republicans argued that access to guns on the house floor is really a safety measure in the event that a shooter were to ever enter the chambers, but a Mother Jones investigation of mass shootings found that in \u201cnot a single case was the killing stopped by a civilian using a gun.\u201d", "topic": "Gun Control", "politicalLabel": "Liberal", "organization": "ThinkProgress", "biasLabel": "Biased", "title": "Credit Cards Are Just As 'Deadly' As Firearms, Opponent Of Gun Control Claims", "yellowLabel": "Not Yellow", "tags": "set(['POLICE', 'CLIMATE CHANGE', 'OBAMACARE', 'POLICE BRUTALITY', 'New Hampshire', 'FERGUSON', 'Guns'])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
