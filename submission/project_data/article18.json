{"content": "A colleague and I were talking the other day about the new Kevin Smith movie, \u201cTusk\u201d \u2014 and how we\u2019re desperately hoping to like one of his projects again.\n\nI bet a lot of people feel the same way.\n\nHow could you not love \u201cClerks\u201d? Smith\u2019s first film was fresh and funny, full of nerdy pop-culture references, and characters like the wastoid duo Jay and Silent Bob were hilarious.\n\nAnd how could you not love the guy himself? A regular dude from New Jersey, he financed his first feature with personal credit cards. He wore oversize hockey jerseys, led marathon Q&A sessions with his fans and mingled at comic conventions.\n\n\u201cMallrats\u201d from 1995 had a certain geeky appeal. \u201cChasing Amy\u201d in 1997 seemed like rom-com done right. Even 2006\u2019s \u201cClerks II\u201d had merit.\n\nAnd then his work started to lose something.\n\nNo one can sustain a winning streak indefinitely, but in Smith\u2019s case, it really seems to be a case of what he was smoking. And how much.\n\nHe said that while working on 2008\u2019s \u201cZack and Miri Make a Porno,\u201d star Seth Rogen pestered him to get high. Smith finally relented.\n\n\u201cWe sat back, watched some footage and sat there smoking,\u201d Smith told MTV. \u201cAnd I loved who I was. I loved how the inhibition dropped away and I loved just being honest.\u201d\n\nA lot of great artists have been fueled by drugs. The Beatles owe a lot of their musical evolution to cannabis and LSD. Norman Mailer, Hunter S. Thompson and Carl Sagan have all sung the praises of illicit substances.\n\nWho cares what anybody\u2019s process is? If you need to eat peyote in an Arizona sweat lodge to produce, knock yourself out. Only results matter.\n\nExcept Smith\u2019s habit hasn\u2019t been earning him results. He thought \u201cZack and Miri\u201d would earn $100 million, three times what it actually made. What was he smoking? Oh, wait.\n\n\u201cCop Out,\u201d his next film, was even worse. \u201cHe smokes way too much pot,\u201d an anonymous source told the Hollywood Reporter about Smith. \u201cHe sat behind his monitor . . . The actors felt they were on their own.\u201d\n\nSmith denied the charge and accused star Bruce Willis of being a jerk. (Probably true.)\n\nStill, it was clear Smith was sliding. He lashed out at his critics, threatening that journalists would never be allowed to see another one of his movies for free.\n\nEven his job moonlighting as a comic book writer suffered. In the 1990s, he helped resurrect Marvel\u2019s \u201cDaredevil.\u201d By 2010, he was behind a Batman book that Comics Alliance called the worst Dark Knight comic ever.\n\n\u201cI wrote it completely stoned,\u201d Smith said of the story in which Batman wets himself from fear. \u201cLike, I remember writing it, like blazing, writing, waking up the next morning, reading it going, \u2018This is dope,\u2019 because I didn\u2019t remember writing it.\u201d\n\nNow he\u2019s got \u201cTusk,\u201d a movie about Justin Long being surgically turned into a walrus that\u2019s probably only entertaining if you\u2019re high.\n\nIt might be time to accept the fact that the old Smith isn\u2019t coming back. He\u2019s gone up in smoke.", "topic": "Marijuana Legalization", "politicalLabel": "Neutral", "organization": "New York Post", "biasLabel": "Biased", "title": "Dear Kevin Smith: Stop smoking so much weed", "yellowLabel": "Yellow", "tags": "set(['Kevin Smith', 'Marijuana', 'Tusk'])", "opinionLabel": "Opinion Article"}
