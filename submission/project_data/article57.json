{"content": "Ted Cruz\u2019s official campaign isn\u2019t even two weeks old, and already it\u2019s done the nation a favor \u2014 by highlighting the duplicity of the \u201cmulticultural\u201d left and what it is really after.\n\nEver since Cruz announced his candidacy for president, \u201cLatino leaders\u201d have been stepping all over themselves to declare that not only does he not speak for Hispanics (something only they presumably do) but he\u2019s not even a \u201clegitimate\u201d Hispanic.\n\nAll of which serves to pull the curtain back on multiculturalism: Defined by liberals, it\u2019s a concept that exists solely to advance liberal objectives.\n\nIt\u2019s not ancestry that makes one a member of a group but whether one adheres to the leftist worldview that created the group-identity mindset in the first place.\n\nAnd it\u2019s certainly not designed to serve the interests of the individual members of any group, beyond the \u201cbenefit\u201d of fostering an \u201cus vs. them\u201d mentality. Thus, the dismissal of Cruz\u2019s \u201chispanicity.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlthough Ted Cruz has a Latino name and immigration in his past, there the similarities between the Latino community and him end,\u201d the co-directors of the Dream Act Coalition, Cesar Vargas and Erika Andiola, said.\n\nMatt Barreto, founder of the leftist-leaning Latino Decisions polling group, took it a step further: \u201cHe is going to go after the vote of the people who don\u2019t like Latinos \u2014 that\u2019s his crowd, the anti-immigration crowd.\u201d\n\nSen. Cruz, added Barreto, opposes illegal immigration and ObamaCare, and these positions make him a pariah among Hispanics.\n\nAnd who can forget how former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson said that he didn\u2019t think Cruz should even \u201cbe defined as a Hispanic\u201d?\n\nRichardson, himself often identified in the media as \u201ca leading Hispanic,\u201d is Mexican on his mother\u2019s side. Cruz is Cuban on his father\u2019s. The Rev. Rafael Bienvenido Cruz was born in Matanzas, Cuba.\n\nFar from running away from his father\u2019s legacy, Cruz speaks often about Rafael\u2019s experiences in Cuba, how he suffered imprisonment and torture there.\n\nHe also very often uses the Cuban Revolution as a cautionary tale for what could happen in this country if we adopt central planning.\n\nAnd Cruz speaks about his father\u2019s immigrant travails in this country \u2014 how he washed dishes and made his way, despite starting out with literally only a fistful of dollars.\n\nAgain, the senator makes full use of his father\u2019s immigrant story as a parable that demonstrates the virtues of America.\n\nNow, the Census Bureau is crystal clear in its definitions: \u201c \u2018Hispanic or Latino\u2019 refers to a person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin regardless of race.\u201d\n\nAs I and many others have long argued, \u201cHispanics,\u201d like \u201cAsians,\u201d is a synthetically made ethnicity with little basis in reality, but this is what the definition is.\n\nThe problem for Ted Cruz is that his and Rafael\u2019s story of endurance, assimilation and ultimate achievement gets it all backward \u2014 as far as the guardians of multiculturalism are concerned.\n\nThey don\u2019t want immigrants, at least not immigrants as we\u2019ve traditionally thought of them. What the multiculturalists want is something else altogether: They look at the same people and see instead minorities.\n\nMinorities \u2014 a concept that came into vogue only in the 1970s \u2014 are different. They have grievances that come from \u201ca history of past discrimination\u201d and therefore require \u201cremedies,\u201d such as affirmative action and quotas.\n\nFar from practices that instill pride in immigrant achievement or the country that made it possible, what results is a mindset that nurtures grievances and divides society.\n\nMinorities take the nation from E Pluribus Unum to, in Mayor David Dinkins\u2019 words, a Gorgeous Mosaic.\n\nAs John Fonte of the Hudson Institute put it a decade and a half ago, multiculturalism holds that for \u201csubordinate\u201d groups such as minorities to be empowered, it is \u201cnecessary first to delegitimize the dominant belief systems of the predominant groups and to create a \u2018counter-hegemony\u2019 (i.e., a new system of values for the subordinate groups).\u201d\n\nMulticulturalism is a handy way to make counter-hegemony succeed.\n\nPayPal founder Peter Thiel, in his \u201cThe Diversity Myth\u201d (written with David O. Sacks), called it a \u201cword game\u201d that has allowed radicals to succeed, where \u201can honest discussion would not lead to results that fit the desired agenda.\u201d\n\nClearly, the Rev. Rafael Bienvenido Cruz and the son he raised would want no part of that. No wonder they find themselves kicked off the Hispanic island.\n\nMike Gonzalez is a senior fellow at The Heritage Foundation and author of \u201cA Race for the Future: How Conservatives Can Break the Liberal Monopoly on Hispanic Americans.\u201d", "topic": "Immigration", "politicalLabel": "Conservative", "organization": "New York Post", "biasLabel": "Biased", "title": "Why Latino \u2018leaders\u2019 reject Ted Cruz", "yellowLabel": "Not Yellow", "tags": "set(['2016 Presidential Election', 'Latinos', 'multiculturalism', 'Ted Cruz'])", "opinionLabel": "Opinion Article"}
