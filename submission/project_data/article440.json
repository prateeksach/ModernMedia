{"content": "Bill Jack wants to make one thing perfectly clear: Bakers should not be forced to make a cake that would violate their conscience or freedom of expression.\n\nJack, of Castle Rock, Colo., is making national headlines over an experiment he conducted in the wake of attacks on Christian business owners who refuse to provide services for same-sex marriages.\n\nADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT\n\nLast year, the Colorado Civil Rights Commission ruled that the Masterpiece Cakeshop in Lakewood unlawfully discriminated against a gay couple who wanted a wedding cake. Jack Phillips, the owner of the cake shop, is a devout Christian, and his attorneys argued that to force him to participate in the gay wedding would violate his religious beliefs.\n\nThe Civil Rights Commission saw it differently.\n\nCLICK HERE TO FOLLOW TODD ON FACEBOOK FOR CONSERVATIVE CONVERSATION.\n\nSo if Christian bakers who oppose gay marriage are compelled under law to violate their beliefs \u2013 what about bakers who support gay marriage? Would they be compelled to make an anti-gay marriage cake?\n\nJack, who is a devout Christian, asked three bakeries to produce two cakes \u2013 each shaped like an open Bible.\n\nOn one side of one cake he requested the words, \u201cGod hates sin \u2013 Psalm 45:7.\u201d On the other side he wanted the words, \u201cHomosexuality is a detestable sin \u2013 Leviticus 18:22.\u201d\n\nOn the second cake he asked them to write another Bible verse: \u201cWhile we were yet sinners Christ died for us \u2013 Romans 5:8\u201d along with the words \u201cGod loves sinners.\u201d\n\nAnd finally, Jack wanted the bakers to create an image \u2013 two grooms holding hands, with a red \u201cX\u201d over them \u2013 the universal symbol for \u201cnot allowed.\u201d\n\nNow if you read the national news accounts of Jack\u2019s experiment \u2013 you would\u2019ve read that he wanted gay slurs written on the cakes. But that wasn\u2019t true.\n\nAccording to the commission\u2019s own report, there\u2019s no mention of Jack using any gay slurs \u2013 unless you consider Bible verses to be gay slurs.\n\nMark Silverstein, the legal director for Colorado\u2019s chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, accused Jack of wanting obscenities written on the cakes.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no law that says that a cake-maker has to write obscenities in the cake just because the customer wants it,\u201d he told the Associated Press.\n\nDoes the ACLU consider the Bible to be obscene?\n\nAs you probably guessed, the bakeries rejected Jack\u2019s request for what some would call \u201canti-gay\u201d cakes.\n\n\u201cIf he wants to hate people, he can hate them not here in my bakery,\u201d Azucar Bakery owner Marjorie Silva told 7NEWS. She called the writing and imagery \u201chateful and offensive.\u201d\n\nSo Jack filed a discrimination complaint with the Colorado Civil Rights Commission \u2013 just as the gay couple did in the Masterpiece Cakeshop case.\n\nUsing the commission\u2019s logic \u2013 if a Christian baker is forced to violate his beliefs, shouldn\u2019t all bakers be forced to violate theirs, too?\n\nAbsolutely not, says the Colorado Civil Rights Commission.\n\nIt ruled that Azucar did not discriminate against Jack based on his creed. It argued that the bakery refused to make the cakes because of the \u201cderogatory language and imagery,\u201d The Denver Channel reported.\n\nJack told me it\u2019s a double standard \u2013 pure and simple.\n\n\u201cI think it is hypocritical,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s unequal treatment before the law. The Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act is being used to coerce businesses to participate in events that violate their consciences.\u201d\n\nJack said he decided to conduct his experiment to prove the Colorado law was \u201conly being applied to Christian business people.\u201d\n\n\u201cChristians need to understand that this is the state of Christianity in the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are now second-class citizens. Our free speech is being censored.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, Jack believes the bakeries had the right to deny him service. His point was to draw attention to the hypocrisy.\n\n\u201cI stand for liberty for all, not liberty for some,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have liberty for all, then we have liberty for none.\u201d\n\nAlliance Defending Freedom is a religious liberty law firm that represents the Masterpiece Cakeshop.\n\nIt believes the Civil Rights Commission reached the right conclusion in Jack\u2019s case, but it blasted the commission\u2019s inconsistencies when it came to the case involving its client.\n\n\u201cThe commission\u2019s inconsistent rulings mean that the owners of these three cake shops may run them according to their beliefs, while Jack cannot,\u201d ADF attorney Jeremy Tedesco said.\n\n\u201cThese cake artists should not be forced to violate their conscience, but clearly the commission should have done the same for Jack Phillips,\u201d he said. \u201cHe risks losing his lifelong business altogether if he continues to run it consistent with his faith. Such blatant religious discrimination has no place in our society.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a great point. If the owner of Azucar Bakery can run her business according to her beliefs \u2013 why can\u2019t the owner of the Masterpiece Cakeshop?\n\nTodd Starnes is host of Fox News & Commentary, heard on hundreds of radio stations.
