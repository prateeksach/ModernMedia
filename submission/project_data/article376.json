But that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll stop pushing forward in this area. Next year, many of those states will likely double down on their agenda, making their existing anti-choice laws even tougher.\n\n\u201cSo many restrictions have been adopted over the past couple years,\u201d Elizabeth Nash, who is responsible for tracking state-level abortion policy for the Guttmacher Institute, told ThinkProgress. \u201cSo now the next step is to see how to make them more burdensome \u2014 harder for women and harder for providers.\u201d\n\nFor instance, the states that require women to receive counseling before ending a pregnancy, but currently allow that information to be read over the phone, could tighten their laws so that women are required to make an in-person trip to the clinic. And the states that already target abortion clinics by requiring them to meet strict building code standards could increase the pressure even further, piling on a new law requiring abortion doctors to obtain admitting privileges from local hospitals.\n\nWe\u2019re already seeing this legislative strategy play out in some states.\n\nAlabama and Missouri, for instance, used to have 24-hour waiting periods that required women to wait a day before proceeding with an abortion. This year, they both lengthened the wait \u2014 Alabama pushed it to 48 hours and Missouri became one of the only states to extend it to a full 72 hours. Legislatures in other areas that are hostile to abortion will probably pursue a similar tactic next year.\n\nTexas provides a particularly stark example. There, lawmakers essentially scrapped the state\u2019s existing regulations on abortion clinics and imposed an omnibus package of even harsher ones. In Nash\u2019s words, the state updated its requirements to make them \u201cnearly impossible to meet.\u201d As a result, throughout this year, the rest of the country watched dozens of clinics get forced out of business.\n\nThat approach \u2014 which is know as the Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers, or TRAP \u2014 came to define this past year in some advocates\u2019 minds.\n\n\u201cI think the most sinister thing we\u2019ve seen in 2014 was the implementation of TRAP laws,\u201d David Grimes, a clinical professor in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of North Carolina who recently wrote a book about the public health benefits of abortion, told ThinkProgress. \u201cThe Republicans in Texas want to send women into the back alley once again.\u201d\n\nTRAP wasn\u2019t invented in Texas. These type of laws were in place in other places, like Kansas and Virginia, even before Wendy Davis\u2019 infamous filibuster against the Lone Star State\u2019s proposed restrictions in the summer of 2013.\n\nBut Texas gave other states a clear illustration of exactly how restrictive TRAP laws can be, especially since the law went into effect relatively quickly. That\u2019s changed the national landscape in some significant ways; for one, states like Oklahoma and Louisiana followed in Texas\u2019 footsteps and enacted admitting privilege laws this year that are equally harsh. In a broad swath of the South, women\u2019s access to clinics now threatens to narrow even further.\n\nGroups like the Guttmacher Institute don\u2019t expect waiting periods or TRAP laws to go away anytime soon. Now that Texas has essentially served as a legislative model for how to attack clinics, Nash expects to see more states trying to figure out how to toughen their own regulations. She\u2019s also anticipating more extended waiting periods next year now that courts have allowed those laws to stand.\n\n\u201cReproductive rights\u2019 advocates jobs have gotten harder, if you thought that was possible,\u201d Nash said.", "topic": "Abortion", "politicalLabel": "Liberal", "organization": "ThinkProgress", "biasLabel": "Biased", "title": "Anti-Abortion Laws Are Expected To Get Even Worse In The New Year", "yellowLabel": "Not Yellow", "tags": "set(['ABORTION', 'Abortion', 'FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION', 'REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS', 'OBAMACARE', 'SCIENCE', 'Reproductive Rights'])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
