Besides the warships that took part in the sea, dozens of military aircraft roared overhead.\n\nPutin paid tribute to Sevastopol's long military record as he addressed servicemen in the harbor, and he said he was sure that 2014 would become known in history as the year Crimea's people decided to return to Russia and the memory of their ancestors.\n\n\"There is a lot of work to be done, but we will overcome all the difficulties because we are together. This means we have become even stronger, and I congratulate you on the great victory,\" he said.\n\nPutin shook hands with servicemen after his remarks, before walking to barriers where he was greeted by screaming crowds.\n\nAn earlier military parade by land vehicles through the city also attracted big numbers, with the turnout probably boosted by rumors that Putin might attend.\n\nThe Russian President's first Victory Day appearance was in Moscow, where the annual display of nationalistic fervor was heightened by Russia's annexation of Crimea.\n\nTanks, rocket launchers and even intercontinental ballistic missiles were paraded through the capital's Red Square in a Soviet-style show of military might, as tens of thousands of people watched and cheered, waving Russian flags.\n\nIn televised remarks there, Putin hailed his nation's \"all-conquering patriotism.\"\n\nGunfire, smoke in Mariupol streets\n\nMeanwhile, a live video stream from the Ukrainian city of Mariupol showed a tense situation with gunfire and black smoke in the streets.\n\nAvakov, on his Facebook page, said about 60 \"terrorists,\" armed with automatic weapons, had launched an attack on Mariupol's police department.\n\nJust Watched Ukraine and Russia face off at Eurovision replay More Videos ...

Three \"casualties\" were reported among the separatists, and some Ukrainian officers were hurt, lawmaker Oleg Lyashko said.\n\nCNN is not able independently to verify either account at this time.\n\nLive video from Mariupol showed what appeared to be bloody footprints and blood splatters at several scenes in the city center, while people were taking cover at the sound of what appeared to be bursts of gunfire.\n\nIrina Voropaeva, who is one of the leaders of the pro-Russian camp in Mariupol, told CNN there were two hotspots in the city.\n\nShe said it was unclear what was unfolding at the main police station. But, she said, the Ukrainian military is in the city center and she had been told that the city hall building is on fire. She added that she could see smoke and hear explosions.\n\nMariupol has become a flashpoint in the standoff between Ukrainian forces and the separatists. Five pro-Russian activists were killed overnight Wednesday when Ukrainian forces attacked barricades on the outskirts of Mariupol, a spokeswoman for the pro-Russian camp said.\n\nUkrainian forces also continue to surround the town of Slovyansk, a stronghold for pro-Russian militants.\n\nChaotic transition\n\nA large majority in Sevastopol, as well as across the Crimean Peninsula, voted in favor of seceding from Ukraine and joining Russia in a controversial referendum in March. Moscow's annexation of the Black Sea territory, which was part of Russia until 1954 and has a majority ethnic Russian population, soon followed.\n\nSevastopol residents told a CNN team early Friday that they were proud and happy to be part of Russia again.\n\nTheir enthusiasm comes despite a messy, sometimes chaotic, process of transition and the continued presence on the streets of local \"self-defense\" units, or militias, known as the \"men in green.\"\n\nNot everyone is delighted by Russia's annexation of Crimea, however. The indigenous ethnic minority Tatar population opposed the move.\n\nOne local Tatar leader, Abduraman Egiz, told CNN he was beaten up by a group of \"men in green\" after they demanded to see his identification documents.\n\n\"We as the community, we cannot guarantee the security of our people,\" he said.\n\nAuthorities in Ukraine scaled back Victory Day events in the capital, Kiev, and elsewhere, anxious to avoid any big celebrations or demonstrations of support for Russia that could spark violence.\n\nOdessa and Kharkiv canceled all big public events, while Luhansk asked groups to avoid gathering in the city. The city of Donetsk, however, was pushing ahead with events.\n\nReferendum postponement call\n\nLess than two months after Crimea was wrested from Ukraine's grasp, there are fears that other parts of the country could go the same way.\n\nPro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine said Thursday that they had decided to go ahead with a Sunday referendum on greater local powers, defying a call by Putin to postpone the vote.\n\nPutin had urged the pro-Russian sympathizers to delay the referendum to give dialogue \"the conditions it needs to have a chance.\"\n\nBut representatives from the council of the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic and separatists from Luhansk told reporters they had voted to press ahead with the vote.\n\nThe West has strongly opposed the move.\n\nIn a statement Friday, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius condemned the pro-Russian separatists for holding \"illegal referendums.\"\n\nFabius, who spoke by phone with Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk, also reiterated France's determination to find a political solution to the crisis in Ukraine.\n\nThe immediate priority is to de-escalate the situation, engage in a national dialogue and prepare for the May 25 elections, Fabius said.\n\n\"On the local 'referenda,' we strongly emphasize that they should not take place -- neither on 11 May nor at any later date,\" said Maja Kocijancic, spokeswoman for the European Union's top diplomat, Catherine Ashton. \"Such unauthorized local 'referenda' have no democratic legitimacy and can only lead to further escalation.\"\n\nU.S. Secretary of State John Kerry spoke by phone with both Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Yatsenyuk on Thursday, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said.\n\nREAD: A week in eastern Ukraine\n\nREAD: Opinion: Putin's empire building is not a new Cold War", "tags": "set([])", "title": "Putin arrives in Crimea for Victory Day amid Ukraine crisis"}
