{"content": "King Abdullah arrived, embracing and sitting next to Moaz\u2019s father, Safi al-Kassasbeh. \u201cMoaz held to his true religion and understood humanity,\u201d Safi said. He paused as planes roared overhead, flying back from bombing ISIL-held territory in Syria. \u201cThose are Moaz\u2019s comrades,\u201d one Kassasbeh uncle murmured, eyes welling with tears. Men in the crowd cheered, \u201cLong live the king \u2014 live, live, live.\u201d As Abdullah left, several youths pushed toward the front, waving brown envelopes and asking to join the military. \u201cLet us be martyrs too,\u201d they yelled. \u201cWe will give our lives.\u201d\n\nBut Ansam stayed at home. She sat on the floor with Moaz\u2019s wife, Anwar Tarawneh, who had just returned from the hospital. They became sisters-in-law in July, with weddings one week apart. ISIL had meant nothing to them then, Anwar said.\n\n\u201cWe thought Daesh was a joke, just a bunch of guys with beards and video cameras. We didn\u2019t even know if it was real,\u201d Anwar, 26, said, referring to ISIL by its Arabic acronym. When Jordan joined the U.S.-led coalition against the group in August, Moaz began to pray that his bombs would not kill innocent Muslims, Anwar said. \u201cNow I wish we\u2019d hit them,\u201d she said, referring to ISIL fighters.\n\nAnsam remembered when she saw the video of Japanese hostage Kenji Goto\u2019s beheading, which was released on Jan. 30. She sent Moaz a WhatsApp message as she had every morning since he was captured. \u201cDid you see the beheading, Ma\u2019ozeh?\u201d calling her brother by a nickname. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s real?\u201d\n\nThe Japanese man haunted Ansam\u2019s imagination. She said she screamed once when her husband touched her from behind, imagining he was Goto\u2019s headless corpse. When she opened her kitchen cupboard in the morning, she saw Goto\u2019s head in her cooking pot. At night, she whispered to her husband, \u201cI feel like Moaz\u2019s head is under our bed.\u201d He told her to go to sleep and not to worry. Soon Moaz would return home.\n\n\u201cWe were all sure Moaz would come back,\u201d said 43-year-old Mazen al-Kassasbeh, an English teacher and a second cousin of the pilot. The people of Luwa\u2019ay were angry when Moaz was shot down, Mazen said, but at the king and the anti-ISIL coalition \u2014 not at ISIL. \u201cEveryone was against the coalition because it felt like we were fighting for no reason. We didn\u2019t know what Daesh was. We just heard they were Muslims.\u201d The tribe was so sure ISIL would release Moaz that they began building an arch to welcome him on his return. Ansam bought a new red dress. She was going to wear it when her brother arrived and when the two couples went on vacation to Sharm el-Sheikh, a touristic city in Egypt, which they had planned for June.", "tags": "set(['Human Rights', 'Syria', 'Israel', 'Police', 'Tunisia', 'Science', 'U.S.', \"Syria's War\", 'Sports', 'Environment', 'Culture', 'International', 'Jordan', 'ISIS', 'Islamic State', 'ISIL', 'Technology', 'Economy'])", "title": "In Jordan a Family Mourns as a Nation Erupts"}
