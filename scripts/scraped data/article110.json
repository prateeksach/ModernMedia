{"content": "When President-elect Barack Obama invited Hillary Rodham Clinton to be his secretary of state, he did not just get Mrs. Clinton. He also got the extended circle of political aides she and her husband had collected over her years in the White House, the Senate and the 2008 presidential campaign.\n\nIn her four years at the State Department, Mrs. Clinton was widely admired within the Obama administration as hard-charging and low-profile, and her coterie of political advisers meshed with the White House team better than anyone had expected.\n\nNow, the uproar over her use of only a private email account to conduct government business \u2014 and her aides\u2019 control over what emails to release and when \u2014 threaten to give Mrs. Clinton\u2019s detractors a means to cast her tenure as secretary of state in a new and unflattering light.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a ball of wool that won\u2019t go away until the questions are answered,\u201d said David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to Mr. Obama.\n\nLike a small group of other early advisers to Mr. Obama, Mr. Axelrod was present for some of the bumps involved in incorporating Mrs. Clinton and her team into the State Department after the brutal 2008 primary fight.\n\nBy the time she was sworn in as secretary, her closest aides, who came with her to Foggy Bottom, knew that she communicated only through a private email address. The practice was not a secret, according to a person with direct knowledge of the inner workings of State Department under Mrs. Clinton, and no one thought it necessary that she switch to an official government address, which would have caused her email to be preserved under the 2009 rules and regulations from the National Archives and Records Administration. Neither career foreign service officers nor State Department lawyers suggested that Mrs. Clinton use a department email address, the person said.\n\nBut Mrs. Clinton\u2019s use of a clintonemail.com address, which shielded those emails from public records requests, is now giving ammunition to critics eager to diminish her experience as a globe-trotting diplomat, which allies portray as her strongest credential in seeking the Democratic nomination for president.\n\nMoreover, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s relationship with the Obama White House, which she and her aides worked hard to improve and nurture, once again seems strained. Some of her allies have grumbled that the president\u2019s aides could have done more to support her \u2014 perhaps, one said, by pointing out that the president himself and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s successor, Secretary of State John Kerry, both use private accounts in addition to their government email addresses.\n\nThe White House has walked a careful line, not directly criticizing Mrs. Clinton but also directing most questions to her team.\n\nThe issue came to light after House Republican officials probing the events surrounding the terrorist attack on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012 tried to get copies of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email.\n\nAides to both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama said they had kept one another informed throughout the process; Mrs. Clinton\u2019s team, for example, gave a heads-up to the White House about the original report in The New York Times.\n\n\u201cWe have always had an open line of communication with the White House, from our time at the State Department and beyond,\u201d said Mrs. Clinton\u2019s spokesman, Nick Merrill. \u201cThat continues here, and we\u2019re grateful for it.\u201d\n\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s arrival at the State Department initially left Mr. Obama\u2019s aides fearing that she would try to create a shadow political operation at the agency: She saw to it that Mr. Obama allowed her to bring in an unusually large number of loyalists. (As one person familiar with the confirmation process said last year, \u201cObama didn\u2019t realize that extended to the cafeteria workers.\u201d)\n\nMr. Merrill said Mrs. Clinton had fewer appointees than former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.\n\nAides to Mr. Obama pushed back against several of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s proposed hires and blocked the addition of Sidney Blumenthal, a longtime Clinton adviser, to the State Department\u2019s speechwriting team.\n\n\u201cThere was some mostly petty residual distrust left over from the primary in those days,\u201d said Tommy Vietor, a former National Security Council aide to Mr. Obama.\n\nThere were other well chronicled clashes: Cheryl D. Mills, a lawyer and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s chief of staff, fought with Denis McDonough, then a senior foreign policy adviser to Mr. Obama, over several ambassadorial appointments. And Mrs. Clinton personally had to intervene with Mr. Obama over the appointment of Capricia Marshall, to whom White House aides objected, as chief of protocol.\n\nBut the Obama team\u2019s early fears that Mrs. Clinton, who won 17.5 million votes in the Democratic primary, would steal the spotlight proved unfounded. Instead, administration officials said, Mrs. Clinton was known to bury herself in policy briefing books, talking to Mr. Obama at scheduled 45-minute meetings each week.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t see political tension,\u201d Thomas R. Nides, deputy secretary for management and resources under Mrs. Clinton, said recently. \u201cI saw a phenomenally cooperative State Department and White House.\u201d\n\nYet the current controversy, and the White House\u2019s reaction to it, have called to mind the mutual distrust that characterized the two camps early on. (In 2009, at the height of the swine flu epidemic in Mexico, Mr. Obama once joked that the moment Mrs. Clinton returned from a trip there, she \u201cpulled me into a hug and gave me a big kiss \u2014 told me to get down there myself.\u201d)\n\n\u201cThe mantra for us was \u2018No drama Obama,\u2019 and that didn\u2019t just have to do with us,\u201d said Robert Gibbs, a former White House press secretary, recalling the distinct organizational styles of Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton.\n\nThere had been relative harmony between the White House and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s operation until this week. So far, Mrs. Clinton has tapped the White House communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, and John D. Podesta, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama, for senior roles on her presumptive 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nBut now, the former first lady suddenly looms large on the minds of White House aides again.\n\nA White House press briefing on Wednesday was dominated by questions about her email \u2014 on a day in which the Supreme Court heard arguments in a case threatening the president\u2019s signature health care law and the Justice Department issued a scathing report about the handling of the death of a black teenager in Ferguson, Mo.\n\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s name was brought up some 43 times.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go to Ferguson for a second,\u201d a reporter interjected at one point. \u201cI\u2019ll get back to Hillary.\u201d", "tags": "set([])", "title": "When Clinton Joined Obama Administration, Friction Was Over Staff, Not Email"}
