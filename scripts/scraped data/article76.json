{"content": "WASHINGTON -- Sen. Mark Udall (D-Colo.) isn\u2019t the only one sweating out his tough re-election. Civil liberties groups are dreading the prospect of Senate without Udall, and say a loss to Republican challenger Rep. Cory Gardner may mean major setbacks for transparency.\n\n\u201cA Senate without Udall is a Senate without a real champion,\u201d said Laura Pitter, senior national security counsel at the nonpartisan Human Rights Watch. \u201c[He\u2019s] one of the few politicians who will do what\u2019s right, even when it means confronting his own political leadership.\u201d\n\nUdall, well known as an advocate for government accountability, is clawing for his political life in next month's election, with his zeal for national security reform largely absent from his campaign. That omission may well have helped Republicans gain traction in attacks tying him to the Obama administration. Udall lags his GOP challenger by more than 2 percentage points, according to HuffPost Pollster.\n\nUdall, a longtime mountaineer, sits on both the Intelligence Committee and the Armed Services Committee, putting him in a unique position on national security. As of late, he\u2019s made himself a thorn in the side of the Obama administration\u2019s prized spy agencies, the CIA and National Security Agency.\n\nUdall has been one of the NSA\u2019s staunchest critics in the wake of Edward Snowden\u2019s 2013 revelations of massive, warrantless data collection on millions of Americans. More recently, he has fiercely advocated for the declassification of the Intelligence Committee\u2019s study on the CIA\u2019s post-9/11 enhanced interrogation program, in which suspected terrorists were shipped to secret overseas prisons and subjected to waterboarding and other harsh techniques.\n\nUdall was a key figure in shaking loose an explosive feud that had festered between the Intelligence Committee and the CIA behind closed doors. Through consistent public prodding, Udall helped lay a trail through letters and public hearings that revealed the CIA had improperly accessed Senate computers used by staffers for the committee\u2019s study.\n\nHe was one of only two lawmakers to call for the resignation of CIA Director John Brennan -- an Obama appointee and former counterterrorism adviser to the White House -- over the scandal.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been a very powerful and credible voice, and I think his would be huge shoes to fill,\u201d said Scott Roehm, senior counsel for the Constitution Project, a bipartisan think tank based in Washington.\n\nUdall\u2019s civil liberties advocacy extends through his term in the Senate. In one notable 2011 instance, he vigorously fought his party\u2019s leadership on the National Defense Authorization Act. He objected to provisions of the legislation that would allow for indefinite detention of American citizens without charge or trial, and was the sole vote against the bill in the Democratic-led Armed Services Committee.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s that kind of ability to be the one when it\u2019s 25-to-1 -- that is a quality that is in short supply in the Senate,\u201d said Chris Anders, senior legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nIt\u2019s examples like that, advocates say, that show what Udall\u2019s departure from the Senate would mean. While Gardener has bludgeoned Udall for alignment with Democrats on topics like health care, Udall's positions on national security may offer a valid defense against accusations of serving as a rubber stamp for President Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s definitely deviated from the Obama administration on these issues,\u201d Pitter said. \u201cHe\u2019s not towed the party line in a lot of respects.\u201d\n\nInstead, Udall has found comfortable national security footing with a bipartisan group of lawmakers loosely called the \u201cchecks and balances caucus,\u201d where he and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) join Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Mike Lee (R.-Utah) to champion civil liberties causes.\n\nThey group has clout, and has pushed several issues. But it\u2019s small. The loss of Udall -- who carries extra weight because he belongs to the majority party -- would hurt.\n\n\u201cWhen you actually list out the number of senators who work on pushing back, it\u2019s a short list,\u201d Anders said. \u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous amount of work to do. So if you lose one of those people, it\u2019s a big loss. It\u2019s a big loss for the country.\u201d\n\nAnders stressed that the ACLU\u2019s stance is nonpartisan, pointing out that the organization has supported Republicans as well as Democrats in the fight for civil liberties in Washington. Udall\u2019s importance as an advocate for transparency, he said, far outweighs his ties to the Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s why I feel comfortable having this conversation,\u201d Anders said. \u201cHe\u2019s not just any other senator on these key issues. He\u2019s someone who actually uses as much power as he has in the Senate to push back. And doing it within the president\u2019s own party does give it more force than doing it from the opposing party. It\u2019s a key thing.\u201d\n\nPolls show Gardner's lead over Udall widening, with less than two weeks until Election Day.\n\n\u201cUdall has been a stalwart advocate for civil liberties and one of the few politicians willing to stand up to the CIA and for what he believes in,\u201d Pitter said. \u201cSo it\u2019s hard to believe his race is even contested.\u201d\n\n---------------------------\n\nWhat's happening in your district?
