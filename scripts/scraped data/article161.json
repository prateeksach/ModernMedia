I think that is precisely that drifting into a strategic confrontation \u2026 makes it a truly dangerous situation,\u201d said Henning, a fellow with the national security think-tank Truman National Security Project.\n\nBoth believe the U.S. should have a cautious approach with this potential unraveling situation, including sending arms to Ukraine.\n\n\u201cJust giving weapons to Ukraine without giving them enough training to use them or strengthening the Ukrainian state will not be productive,\u201d said Blank.\n\nHenning cautions \u201cthat we are really not good at arming our allies \u2013 we weren\u2019t good at it in Vietnam, Afghanistan, or Iraq \u2026 we need to be realistic about our ability to build the capacity for the Ukrainian government to receive and responsibly use those military capabilities and we have to be realistic about Russian reactions.\u201d\n\n\n\nExperts are debating whether Russian President Vladimir Putin is acting haphazardly for a reason.\n\n\u201cThere is certainly a tactical element to his actions \u2026 at a fundamental level, Russia has not yet decided if it can live as modern nation-state within its boundaries and \u2026 it\u2019s important not to underestimate how well Putin understands these things and it\u2019s important not to underestimate his strategic ambitions,\u201d said Henning.\n\n\u201cWe are going to see constant probes by Russia unless we thwart them in Ukraine,\u201d said Blank.", "positionLabels": ["factual"], "politicalLabels": ["neutral"]}
