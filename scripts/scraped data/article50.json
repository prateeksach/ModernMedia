{"content": "As the clock ticks down on the lives of two Japanese hostages held by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) somewhere in Syria or Iraq, their plight has triggered renewed debate back home on Japan\u2019s role in international conflict. The same movement that released grisly beheading videos of U.S. journalists and others has threatened to do the same to Kenji Goto and Haruna Yukawa unless Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pays a $200 million ransom. Abe says he considers the lives of the Japanese nationals a \u201ctop priority\u201d but refuses to compromise. \"We will never give in to terrorism,\" he said. On Tuesday, while Abe was touring the Middle East, ISIL released a video of the captives, handcuffed and kneeling, wearing the orange jumpsuits that have become a trademark of the movement\u2019s execution videos. A masked man, speaking British-accented English and waving a knife, stands over them and is heard saying Japan had \u201cwillingly taken part in a holy war\u201d and provided $200 million to \u201ckill Muslim women and children and destroy Muslim homes.\u201d He promises the two men will be executed unless the ransom is paid within 72 hours. The sum is an apparent reference to Abe\u2019s pledge of $200 million in \u201cnon-military aid\u201d to countries in the region fighting ISIL. Abe had made the pledge Saturday in Cairo as part of a $2.5 billion aid package. Japanese commentators speculate that the man in the video is \u201cJihadi John,\u201d suspected of beheading U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff last year. The Japanese government presumes the deadline expires at 2:50 p.m. Tokyo time on Friday. Abe has requested help from Jordan, Turkey and Egypt, and officials have reportedly contacted religious groups and NGOs in an attempt to rescue the men. Abe has not stated whether the government would pay the ransom. But the hostage drama, which has stunned the nation, has also ignited renewed debate about Japan\u2019s role in the Middle East. Japan\u2019s pacifist constitution has generally translated into token military support for the U.S. \u201cwar on terror.\u201d But Abe has made no secret of his desire for Japan to take a more robust role in global affairs.\n\nReliant on oil\n\nJapan relies on the Middle East for most of the crude oil it needs to run the world\u2019s third-largest economy. Abe\u2019s visit this week was designed to promote Japanese technology and investment in the region, and more than 100 government officials and company bosses accompanied him when the ISIL video was released. Some Japanese experts have criticized Abe. Masanori Naito, a professor of Muslim studies at Doshisha University, said, \u201cHis trip should have been planned more discreetly, especially after the terrorist attacks in France.\u201d The prime minister should have made an appeal for Yukawa\u2019s safety, Naito added. Yukawa went missing in Syria in August. Professor Satoshi Ikeuchi, another Islam specialist at the University of Tokyo, said ISIL took advantage of Abe\u2019s trip, issuing the threat when the world was watching. \u201cThey believe money is the only thing they can get from Japan,\u201d wrote Ikeuchi in an online message. \u201cIt is an expression of contempt often seen in Arab countries.\u201d Another expert said Abe\u2019s approach had little hope of bringing home the two hostages. \u201cOf course we should not yield to terrorism, but joining the international allies to put pressure on the militants will never lead to resolving the crisis or reconciliation,\u201d said Ken Takada, director of A Civic Group Against Constitutional Revision in Japan. He says the Abe administration antagonized the kidnappers by showing support for a war against ISIL. Takada wants Abe to protect Japan\u2019s war-averse constitution, which he says can prevent the country from becoming embroiled in crises such as the current one. Nationalists who support Abe say Japan needs offensive forces precisely for scenarios such as the kidnapping drama. The government is expected to submit a bill this month allowing the dispatch of Japan\u2019s Self-Defense Forces to support the U.S. and other allies in battle. The right to join the allied forces was approved by the cabinet last year. Takada\u2019s organization denounced that decision, saying in a statement: \u201cWe want the government of Japan not to take the dangerous and erroneous path of joining the U.S. in its global war, but to pursue genuine international contributions based on the Peace Constitution.\u201d\n\nFear of remilitarization", "tags": "set(['Human Rights', 'Shinzo Abe', 'Israel', 'Police', 'Press Freedom', 'Tunisia', 'Science', 'U.S.', 'Sports', 'Environment', 'Culture', 'International', 'Japan', 'ISIS', 'Terrorism', 'ISIL', 'Technology', 'Economy'])", "title": "Isil Kidnappings Trigger Debate Japan Global Role"}
