(Pavel Golovkin/Associated Press)\n\nMOSCOW \u2014 Speaking to tens of thousands of cheering supporters just outside the Kremlin walls, President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday described Russia\u2019s annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula as a move to protect ethnic Russians there and regain the nation\u2019s \u201chistoric roots.\u201d\n\nAddressing a rally marking the anniversary of the annexation, Putin also vowed to stand up to the West, which responded to the Russian move by slapping painful sanctions on Russia.\n\nThe 62-year old Russian leader, who resurfaced Monday after a 10-day absence from public view that fueled intense speculation about his health and hold on power, looked energetic and spoke forcefully to the enthusiastic crowd, which gathered just off the Red Square near St.Basil\u2019s Cathedral.\n\n\u201cWe realized that it wasn\u2019t just about territory, which we have enough,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about historic roots, about roots of our spirituality and statehood.\u201d\n\nHe went on to say that he continues to think that \u201cRussians and Ukrainians are one people,\u201d and voiced hope that the Ukrainians would come to condemn \u201cextreme nationalists\u201d and the two nations could restore normal relations.\n\nFighting that flared up in eastern Ukraine between Moscow-backed separatists and government troops shortly after the annexation of Crimea has claimed more than 6,000 lives, according to the United Nations. Ukraine and the West have accused Russia of fueling the mutiny with troops and weapons, accusations Moscow has denied.\n\nThe United States and the European Union have responded with economic and financial sanctions on Russia. Along with slumping oil prices, they have driven the Russian economy into a recession this year.\n\nBut despite the economic downturn and a sharp devaluation of the ruble, Putin\u2019s popularity has remained strong at more than 80 percent. He vowed that Russia will resist the Western pressure, and \u201covercome all the problems and difficulties they have tried to create for us from the outside.\u201d\n\nHe added on a note of self-irony, which contrasted with the festive, proud mood of the rally, that \u201cwe will overcome the difficulties, which we have so easily created for ourselves in recent time.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t clear what Putin meant, but Kremlin critics have held the president responsible for driving Russia into isolation with the annexation of Crimea and support for the separatists in eastern Ukraine. They said the Kremlin has made matters worse by banning most Western food in retaliation to the U.S. and the EU sanctions, a move that helped fuel inflation and contributed to a plunge in living standards.\n\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
