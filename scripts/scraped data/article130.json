(Oded Balilty, File/Associated Press)\n\nJERUSALEM \u2014 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu apologized to Israel\u2019s Arab citizens on Monday for remarks he made during last week\u2019s parliament election that offended members of the community.\n\nThe move appeared to be an attempt to heal rifts and mute criticism at home and in the United States. Netanyahu drew accusations of racism in Israel, especially from its Arab minority, and a White House rebuke when, just a few hours before polling stations were to close across the country, he warned that Arab citizens were voting \u201cin droves.\u201d\n\nBut President Barack Obama\u2019s chief of staff, Denis McDonough, rejected Netanyahu\u2019s attempt to distance himself from his comments, telling an Israel advocacy group Monday that the U.S. can\u2019t just overlook what Netanyahu said on the eve of his re-election.\n\nNetanyahu, whose Likud Party won re-election in the vote, met with members of the Arab community at the prime minister\u2019s residence in Jerusalem on Monday and apologized.\n\nHe said he knows his \u201ccomments last week offended some Israeli citizens and offended members of the Israeli-Arab community.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was never my intent. I apologize for this,\u201d Netanyahu said. \u201cI view myself as the prime minister of each and every citizen of Israel, without any prejudice based on religion, ethnicity or gender.\u201d\n\n\u201cI view all Israeli citizens as partners in the building of a prosperous and safe state of Israel, for all Israelis,\u201d he also said.\n\nA recently established alliance of four small, mostly Arab parties called the Joint List made unprecedented gains in the March 17 election, earning enough votes to make it the third-largest party in Israel\u2019s parliament. Arab citizens make up 20 percent of Israel\u2019s population. Equality is guaranteed in Israel\u2019s laws but many Arabs have long complained of discrimination, mainly in the job and housing market.\n\nAyman Odeh, the head of the Joint List, told channel 2 TV that Netanyahu\u2019s apology was not accepted.\n\n\u201cThis is not a real apology,\u201d Odeh said. \u201cHe incited against citizens who were exercising their basic right to vote for Knesset.\u201d\n\nOdeh also accused Netanyahu of \u201czigzagging\u201d by saying one thing one day and a different another.\n\nIn the final days of the campaign, Netanyahu angered the U.S. by taking a tough stance toward the Palestinians and by saying a Palestinian state will not be established on his watch in the current climate of regional chaos and violence. Resolving the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians in a two state solution is a key U.S. foreign policy priority.\n\nIn his speech to J Street, an Israel advocacy group that is sharply critical of Netanyahu, McDonough warned Israel against annexing the West Bank, where Palestinians hope to establish their future state. He said Netanyahu\u2019s prediction that a Palestinian state wouldn\u2019t come about on his watch was \u201cvery troubling\u201d and questioned Netanyahu\u2019s broader commitment to the two-state solution the U.S. and Israel have officially supported for years.\n\n\u201cWe cannot simply pretend that these comments were never made,\u201d McDonough said.\n\nObama\u2019s decision to dispatch his chief of staff to speak to J Street was seen as another sign that Obama intends to take a tougher tack toward Netanyahu.\n\nIsraelis and Palestinians are closely watching to see how U.S. policy will change in practical terms after Netanyahu\u2019s success in the elections. Obama has said the U.S. must reevaluate its approach to pursuing Mideast peace because of Netanyahu\u2019s comments, and has entertained speculation the U.S. will be less willing to come to Israel\u2019s defense in the United Nations. The U.S. has voted against U.N. resolutions supporting the establishment of a Palestinian state, insisting the matter should be negotiated directly with Israel.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s tough talk was part of a last-ditch attempt to spur his more hard-line supporters to the polls after it appeared he was losing voters to a more hawkish party.\n\nNetanyahu defended his election-day remarks in the days after the vote. He told NBC last Thursday that he remains committed to Palestinian statehood \u2014 if conditions in the region improve \u2014 and to the two-state vision first spelled out in a landmark 2009 speech at Israel\u2019s Bar Ilan University. \u201cI haven\u2019t changed my policy,\u201d he said. \u201cI never retracted my speech.\u201d\n\nHe told NBC that his government has spent billions in Arab towns to upgrade infrastructure, schools and narrow gaps.\n\nEarlier on Monday, Netanyahu secured a majority of backers in the new parliament and will later be tasked with forming the next government.\n\nIsrael\u2019s ceremonial president, Reuven Rivlin, has been meeting with the parties in parliament to hear their recommendations before appointing who will form the next coalition government. Kulanu, a new centrist party gave its nod to Netanyahu on Monday, giving him 61 backers out of the 120 in parliament.\n\nNetanyahu appears poised to set up a coalition with hawkish, centrist and religious parties.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Matt Lee and Josh Lederman in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
