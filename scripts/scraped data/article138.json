Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Baltimore, is Maryland\u2019s lone co-sponsor.\n\nOrganizers of \u201cThe Day We Fight Back\u201d include Demand Progress, Fight for the Future, Free Press, Reddit, Mozilla and ThoughtWorks. The sponsors are encouraging individuals, in addition to companies and groups, to take part by posting #StoptheNSA on social media.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re expecting thousands of smaller sites in addition to a number of big ones like Tumblr and Reddit,\u201d said David Segal, the executive director of Demand Progress.\n\n'We\u2019re expecting thousands of smaller sites in addition to a number of big ones like Tumblr and Reddit.' - David Segal, the executive director of Demand Progress\n\nSimilar tactics were used two years ago by a handful of the same sites involved in the coalition to protest the Stop Online Piracy Act, an anti-piracy bill. The date for this week\u2019s protest is meant to commemorate the two-year anniversary of the collapse of SOPA.\n\nStanding with the opposition, major websites like Google, Reddit and Wikipedia went dark for a day in January 2012. The blackout drew widespread attention against the bill and contributed to its demise.\n\nSponsors of this month\u2019s event include big names in social media, in addition to a wide array of advocacy organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union and the conservative FreedomWorks. The real question, however, is whether or not the larger public will take notice.\n\nUnlike SOPA, the current debate deals with national security issues that can be more sensitive.\n\nCarla Howell, executive director of the national Libertarian Party, said the protest is a backlash against Democrats and Republicans who have passed bills like the Patriot Act and Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The Libertarian Party is one of the protest\u2019s organizers.\n\n\u201cPoliticians are now on the defensive and starting to come around to admitting that what they\u2019ve done is highly unpopular, rejected by the American people, and being cast as an egregious violation of our rights,\u201d said Howell. \u201cMore and more politicians are being forced to line up to support bills in favor of NSA drawback.\u201d\n\nPolling results on the issue have evolved with more Americans disapproving of the NSA\u2019s data collection program today than when it was first exposed by leaker Edward Snowden. A Pew Research Center poll last month found that 53 percent of Americans disapproved of the NSA\u2019s program.\n\nIn defense of the NSA\u2019s surveillance tactics last month, James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, told lawmakers that never before had he \u201cexperienced a time when we\u2019ve been more beset by crises and threats around the globe.\u201d For the second year in a row, Clapper named cyber attacks as the biggest threat currently facing the United States.\n\nThe protest is just days away, and the count for participants continues to rise on the website\u2019s ticker. But the organizers don\u2019t know how to gauge the scale of their endeavor, yet.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not in the business of predicting. We will all know come Tuesday how big a splash we\u2019re making,\u201d Segal said.\n\nCapital News Service contributed to this report", "positionLabels": ["critical"], "politicalLabels": ["conservative"]}
