(SAFIN HAMED/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images)\n\n\u2014 This town near the Iranian border has long been a symbol of Kurdish resistance, and it is best known as the site of a gruesome chemical-weapons attack by Saddam Hussein in 1988.\n\nThese days, residents say, it is increasingly known for something else \u2014 although few want to talk about it.\n\nKurdish authorities say a small contingent of Kurdish youths \u2014 around 150 in all, about a third of whom are from Halabja \u2014 has in recent months joined the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), which has seized a vast swath of Iraqi territory.\n\nThe young men\u2019s allegiance to the extremist militant group represents a potential danger for the Kurds, who share the jihadists\u2019 resentment of Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki\u2019s Shiite-dominated government but are wary of the extremists now massed on the edge of their territory. The Kurds have hoped to keep their largely autonomous region in northern Iraq from being entangled in the country\u2019s increasingly bloody conflict.\n\nSome Kurdish intelligence officials fear that with ISIS\u2019s gains, more local youths will join the jihadists and that the radical ideology could creep beyond Arab Iraq and into Iraqi Kurdistan, which has so far remained an oasis of calm and order.\n\nThe presence of Kurdish fighters in the extremist militant group highlights how effectively ISIS\u2019s recruitment efforts are reaching disenfranchised youths across Iraq\u2019s ethnic divide. Most Kurds are Sunni Muslims, like the insurgents, but have their own language and culture.\n\nA top local intelligence official in Halabja, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the news media, said ISIS is already operating \u201ccells\u201d inside the town, appealing to bored and underemployed young people to join their fight.\n\nMost of the 52 local men and boys who have left Halabja in the past year and a half to fight in Syria have been recruited by ISIS, he said.\n\nOne local man, Mariwan Hallabji, has become an ISIS commander and currently serves on a front line against Kurdish pesh merga security forces outside the city of Kirkuk, the official said.\n\n\u201cHow do we guarantee that when they\u2019re done fighting the Shiites, they don\u2019t start waging a war against the Kurds?\u201d the intelligence official said.\n\nA little over a decade ago, Islamist radicals allegedly tied to al-Qaeda had a base here and fought against the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), one of the two major Kurdish political movements, before U.S. forces bombed the Islamists\u2019 bases during the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\n\nHalabja, although relatively far from the front line between Iraqi Kurdistan and ISIS-held territory, is particularly vulnerable to losing its sons to the radical group, local officials and residents said.\n\n1 of 53 Full Screen Autoplay Close June 26, 2014 June 25, 2014 Wednesday June 24, 2014 Tuesday June 23, 2014 Monday June 22, 2014 Sunday Skip Ad \u00d7 Shiite Iraqis prepare to fight Sunni militants View Photos Members of an all-volunteer force undergo training in the holy city of Karbala to protect Shiite shrines and help counter the recent gains of the Sunni insurgent group the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria.
