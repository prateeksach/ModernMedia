But Representative Dana Rohrabacher speaks up for Moscow with pride.\n\nHe is, he says, a bit frosted with the Russian government in one respect.\n\n\u201cI kind of wish I would get some sort of word back,\u201d Mr. Rohrabacher, a California Republican, said Thursday shortly before the House voted 399 to 19 to offer aid to Ukraine and impose sanctions on Russia. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t even gotten so much as a thank you.\u201d\n\nThe 13-term congressman has had a long, strange journey from fierce Cold Warrior to apologist for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. In 1966 when Ronald Reagan was running for governor of California, Mr. Rohrabacher camped out in the candidate\u2019s backyard, pleading for an audience to prevent the disbanding of his Youth for Reagan group in favor of a rival\u2019s. By last year, Mr. Rohrabacher was accompanying the action star Steven Seagal to Russia in search of a broader Islamist plot behind the Boston Marathon bombing. The actor and the congressman had often discussed \u201cthwarting radical Islamic terrorism,\u201d he explained.\n\nThen came Russia\u2019s takeover of Crimea, and Mr. Rohrabacher had to draw the line \u2014 in favor of Mr. Putin.\n\n\u201cThere have been dramatic reforms in Russia that are not being recognized by my colleagues,\u201d he said. \u201cThe churches are full. There are opposition papers being distributed on every newsstand in Russia. You\u2019ve got people demonstrating in the parks. You\u2019ve got a much different Russia than it was under Communism, but you\u2019ve got a lot of people who still can\u2019t get over that Communism has fallen.\u201d\n\nWhat about Pussy Riot, the Russian protest group? Its members were jailed for criticizing Mr. Putin, released, then publicly flogged when they showed up at the Winter Olympics in Sochi.\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think that happens often,\u201d Mr. Rohrabacher said with a shrug. \u201cThere are lots of people demonstrating in the streets of Russia who are perfectly free to do so.\u201d\n\nSurfer, scuba diver, buddy of the rock star Sammy Hagar, Mr. Rohrabacher has always kept to his own beat.\n\nHe claimed last year that he lost a drunken arm-wrestling match with Mr. Putin when he was deputy mayor of St. Petersburg in the 1990s. Three years ago, Mr. Rohrabacher, now 66, was thrown out of Iraq after demanding that the Baghdad government repay the United States for the cost of the 2003 invasion.\n\nHe is now in a legal fight in his native Orange County, Calif., over a house he rented that the owners say he left looking like a pigsty, crawling with maggots.\n\nThere is a history of House members backing unpopular foreign leaders. In 2002, Representative Jim McDermott, Democrat of Washington, made a trip to Baghdad to defend Saddam Hussein\u2019s record on international inspections and his dismantling of unconventional weapons. It earned him the nickname Baghdad Jim from many pro-war conservatives. Representative Jos\u00e9 E. Serrano, Democrat of New York, was such a consistent supporter of President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of Venezuela that he posted on Twitter after the president\u2019s death last year that Mr. Ch\u00e1vez was \u201ccommitted to empowering the powerless.\u201d\n\nThere is some logic to Mr. Rohrabacher\u2019s stalwart defense of the Kremlin\u2019s actions. The people of Crimea have spoken, he says, and voted resoundingly to leave Ukraine and join the Russian Federation. To stand for the sanctity of Ukraine\u2019s national borders, he says, is to stand for \u201csoil and entities\u201d over individual rights and self-determination.\n\nWas Abraham Lincoln wrong, then, to fight the Confederacy\u2019s self-determination? Not at all, Mr. Rohrabacher said. Because women and blacks \u2014 slave or free \u2014 were not allowed to vote, Southern sentiment before the Civil War was not nearly as clear as it is in Crimea.\n\nSixteen other Republicans voted against the Ukraine aid bill on Thursday, but most \u2014 if not all \u2014 did so on fiscal grounds. They included the most vocal members of the Tea Party wing and the usual so-called Dr. Nos of the House, like Justin Amash of Michigan and Thomas Massie of Kentucky.\n\n\u201cRussia has violated Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty; therefore, certain nonmilitary punitive measures against those responsible in Russia may be appropriate,\u201d Mr. Amash explained on his Facebook page. \u201cBut I am not persuaded at this time that U.S.-guaranteed financial assistance for Ukraine\u2019s interim government will produce good outcomes for the United States or Ukraine.\u201d\n\nIt seems that defending the invasion of a sovereign nation and the annexation of part of it is a tough political position to hold. Senator Rand Paul, the libertarian-minded Republican from Kentucky who is considering a White House run, told The Washington Post in February that \u201csome on our side are so stuck in the Cold War era that they want to tweak Russia all the time, and I don\u2019t think that is a good idea.\u201d\n\nBut about two weeks later, in Time magazine, he wrote that \u201cPutin must be punished\u201d and \u201cRussia must learn that the U.S. will isolate it if it insists on acting like a rogue nation.\u201d\n\nMr. Rohrabacher has found a kindred spirit on the fringe of the Democratic Party: Representative Alan Grayson of Florida, whom conservatives love to loathe. He complained bitterly as the House Foreign Affairs Committee drafted its Russia sanctions bill on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWhy are we speaking about naked aggression, why are we speaking about stealing Crimea, why are we speaking about bullying, or the new Soviet Union, or thuggery, or audacious power grabbing, or Bully Bear Putin, or Cold War II?\u201d Mr. Grayson said. \u201cWe should be pleased to see, pleased to see, when a virtually bloodless transfer of power establishes self-determination for two million people somewhere in the world.\u201d", "positionLabels": ["defensive"], "politicalLabels": ["conservative"]}
