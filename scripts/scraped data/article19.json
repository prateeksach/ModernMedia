There\u0092s always grousing about people who don\u0092t bother to vote. But look at it another way: An estimated 133 million Americans will cast ballots in Tuesday\u0092s election. That\u0092s about 6 in 10 eligible adults. Some will persevere despite long lines, pressing personal burdens or the devastation left by Superstorm Sandy. Why do they do it? It\u0092s not because any one voter will decide the contest between President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney. Depending on which state they live in, the odds of casting a deciding vote for president are somewhere between 1 in a million and essentially zero.

One week before a close election, superstorm Sandy has confounded the presidential race, halting early voting in many areas, forcing both candidates to suspend campaigning and leading many to ponder whether the election might be postponed. It could take days to restore electricity to all of the more than 8 million homes and businesses that lost power when the storm pummeled the East Coast. That means it\u0092s possible that power could still be out in some states on Election Day _ a major problem for areas that rely on electronic voting machines.
