{"content": "The Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) published a video on Tuesday that purportedly shows the death by burning of Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kassasbeh.\n\nThe head of the Jordanian armed forces told the family of the pilot that he was killed, a member of the family said.\n\nThe 26-year-old first lieutenant was taken hostage in ISIL's stronghold of Raqqa, Syria, after his F-16 jet crashed in late December. ISIL members claimed to have shot down Kassasbeh's plane with a heat-seeking missile.\n\nIf the video is authenticated, it would be the first time that ISIL has killed a hostage by setting him on fire. Previous videos released by the group have shown the beheadings of captives.", "tags": "set(['Human Rights', 'Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)', 'Israel', 'Police', 'Tunisia', 'Science', 'U.S.', 'Sports', 'Environment', 'Culture', 'Jordan', 'International', 'ISIS', 'Terrorism', 'ISIL', 'Technology', 'Economy'])", "title": "Isil Releases Video Shows Burning of Jordanian"}
