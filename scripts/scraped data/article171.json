It appears to be shiny, but it\u2019s counterfeit.\n\nIn fact, after nearly four years, Obama\u2019s presidency only resembles a time when Clinton was at his worst\u2014in his first two disastrous years in office.\n\nADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn their first two years, both Clinton and Obama didn\u2019t focus on growing jobs and \u201cthe economy, stupid.\u201d Instead, Bubba and Bam preferred using their Democratic majorities in both houses of Congress to push for massive \u201cstimulus\u201d spending by government, government takeovers of the entire health care system, and energy taxation that would have been the biggest tax hike in American history.\n\nRepublican minorities in the House and Senate blocked almost all of Clinton\u2019s agenda and gained majority status in Congress in the 1994 midterm elections. By his midterms, Obama had passed his reforms in health care and financial services, bailed out banks and the auto industry, signed his $862-billion \u201cstimulus\u201d into law, and started pouring billions of taxpayer dollars into his dream of \u201cgreen\u201d energy development.\n\nFor Barack Obama to govern like Bill Clinton in a second term, Obama would have to undergo an ideological and personality transformation.\n\nClinton was chastened by his midterm losses. Counseled by political consultant Dick Morris, Clinton tacked to the center, eventually accepting welfare reform and apologizing for raising taxes on job creators and investors. Clinton backed free trade. At the end of his first term, he declared that, \u201cthe era of big government is over.\u201d Clinton\u2019s cuts in military spending and the dotcom boom buoyed the economy and poured in revenues that reduced government debt.\n\nBy contrast, following his midterm \u201cshellacking\u201d in the 2010 elections, Obama has been an \u201canti-Clinton.\u201d Obama has doubled down on his commitments to: raise taxes on business and investing success; increase government\u2019s size, spending and regulatory reach; and create roadblocks for the abundant fossil fuel extraction and pipelining that could produce a boom in American jobs and new business expansion.\n\nYes, Clinton raised taxes on the wealthy. But with arm-twisting from Republicans, Clinton also cut capital gains taxes. He reduced government spending as a share of GDP to 19.5 percent when he left office (under Obama it is 24 percent), and was way friendlier to businesses than Obama. Obama wants to raise business investment taxes and, according to The Wall Street Journal, has \u201calready raised investment tax rates by 3.8 percentage points as part of ObamaCare.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s un-Clinton-like hostility to small businesses and investors has these groups sitting on trillions of dollars in their assets and has caused the worst recovery from a recession in 70 years.\n\nA recent poll finds that 69 percent of small business owners and manufacturers say that, \u201cPresident Obama\u2019s Executive Branch and regulatory policies have hurt American small businesses and manufacturers.\u201d Further, 67 percent say \u201cthere is too much uncertainty in the market today to expand, grow or hire new workers.\u201d And, 55 percent say, \u201cthey would not start a business today given what they know now and in the current environment.\u201d\n\nFor Barack Obama to govern like Bill Clinton in a second term, Obama would have to undergo an ideological and personality transformation. Political reinvention, negotiation and \u201ctriangulation\u201d are Clinton\u2019s forte\u2014not Obama\u2019s.\n\nAre you willing to bet the next four years\u2014and the future of your children, grandchildren and country\u2014on Obama not being Obama and, magically, becoming Bill Clinton at his best, rather than his worst?\n\nCommunications consultant Jon Kraushar is at www.jonkraushar.net.
