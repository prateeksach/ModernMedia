Kennedy\u2019s 1960 Houston address on the role of religion in public life.\n\nThe statement by Santorum marks the GOP contender\u2019s latest defense of his long-held views on the separation of church and state, although in his Sunday appearance he doubled down on the colorful language he employed in his October speech at a New Hampshire college.\n\nIn remarks last year at the College of Saint Mary Magdalen in Warner, N.H., Santorum had told the crowd of J.F.K.\u2019s famous 1960 address to the Greater Houston Ministerial Association, \u201cEarlier in my political career, I had the opportunity to read the speech, and I almost threw up. You should read the speech.\u201d\n\nIn the speech, Kennedy addressed the concerns of Protestant ministers who doubted whether he would make decisions as president independent of his Catholic faith.\n\n\u201cI believe in an America where the separation of church and state is absolute, where no Catholic prelate would tell the president (should he be Catholic) how to act, and no Protestant minister would tell his parishioners for whom to vote; where no church or church school is granted any public funds or political preference; and where no man is denied public office merely because his religion differs from the president who might appoint him or the people who might elect him,\u201d Kennedy said.\n\nOn Sunday, ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos asked Santorum whether he stood by his statement last year, noting that Santorum\u2019s rival, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney (R), delivered an address on religion during the 2008 campaign that garnered comparisons to Kennedy\u2019s address.\n\nSantorum defended his remarks, telling Stephanopoulos that \u201cthe first line, first substantive line in the speech, says, \u2018I believe in America where the separation of church and state is absolute.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe in an America where the separation of church and state is absolute,\u201d Santorum said. \u201cThe idea that the church can have no influence or no involvement in the operation of the state is absolutely antithetical to the objectives and vision of our country.\u201d\n\nHe went on to note that the First Amendment \u201csays the free exercise of religion \u2014 that means bringing everybody, people of faith and no faith, into the public square.\u201d\n\n\u201cKennedy for the first time articulated the vision saying, \u2018No, faith is not allowed in the public square. I will keep it separate.\u2019 Go on and read the speech. \u2018I will have nothing to do with faith. I won\u2019t consult with people of faith.\u2019 It was an absolutist doctrine that was abhorrent at the time of 1960.\u201d\n\nLater in the interview, Stephanopoulos asked Santorum, \u201cYou think you wanted to throw up?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, yes, absolutely,\u201d Santorum replied. \u201cTo say that people of faith have no role in the public square? You bet that makes you throw up. What kind of country do we live that says only people of non-faith can come into the public square and make their case? That makes me throw up.\u201d\n\nRead more from PostPolitics\n\nSantorum: Obama apology for Koran burning 'unacceptable'\n\nRick Santorum: Obama is a 'snob'\n\nArizona Gov.
