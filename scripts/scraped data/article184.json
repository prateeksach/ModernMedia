But recent tensions between the two nations were evident in Moscow\u2019s displays of military might and the parades and somber graveside tributes in Kiev and eastern Ukraine.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin sought to place himself in the ranks of Russia\u2019s greatest leaders Friday, reaching deep into his nation\u2019s history to assert that the annexation of Crimea was a milestone for the centuries.\n\nIn his first visit to Crimea since he seized the peninsula in March, Putin paid a triumphant call on a territory that had been Russian since the time of Catherine the Great, but since 1991 had been part of an independent Ukraine. The annexation set off an international crisis that has pushed Ukraine to the brink of war and has led to the greatest tensions between Russia and the West since the depths of the Cold War.\n\nPutin reeled off a list of highlights of Russian nationhood that began with the naming of the Black Sea port city of Sevastopol in 1784.\n\n\u201cI am sure that 2014 will become part of the city\u2019s chronicle, and the chronicle of our entire country, as the year in which the people here decided firmly to be together with Russia,\u201d Putin said. In March, Crimeans voted in a referendum in which 97 percent were said to have chosen to bind themselves to Russia.\n\n\u201cThus they proved their loyalty to historical truth and to the memory of our predecessors,\u201d he said at the port as 10 gray warships floated behind him. \u201cWe have lots of work in front of us, but we will overcome all the difficulties, because we are together, and that means we have become stronger.\u201d\n\n[Read a transcript of Putin\u2019s remarks]\n\nOn an emotional holiday that marks the Soviet Union\u2019s victory over Nazi Germany in World War II, Putin flew to Sevastopol after presiding over a triumphal military parade through Moscow\u2019s Red Square. There and in cities across Russia\u2019s vast territory, scores of tanks, rocket launchers and intercontinental ballistic missiles delivered a show of military prowess that Putin has threatened to further unleash on Ukraine if he judges Russian interests to be threatened.\n\nPutin has long aspired to be one of Russia\u2019s epoch-defining leaders, saying that the breakup of the Soviet Union was \u201cthe greatest geopolitical catastrophe\u201d of the 20th century, in part because \u201ctens of millions\u201d of ethnic Russians found themselves outside the borders of Russia. The Russian president has made it his mission to rebuild a country powerful enough to demand the same respect once accorded to the Soviet Union, analysts have said.\n\nIn the Ukrainian crisis, which unfolded at the same time as the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Putin may have seen his chance. Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych fled from office the day before the Olympics\u2019 Closing Ceremonies. Russian forces in Crimea made their moves just a few days later. The annexation of Crimea has driven Putin\u2019s approval ratings to multi-year highs of over 80 percent, after years in which they had been sinking, and there are few mainstream voices to stand in his way.\n\nIf Putin is reelected to another six-year presidential term in 2018, he will be poised to surpass Leonid Brezhnev as the second-longest-serving leader of post-imperial Russia, after Stalin. He has been Russia\u2019s paramount head since Dec. 31, 1999.\n\nDuring his more than 14 years in power, Putin has transformed Victory Day into a celebration of Russian might that he said Friday was his nation\u2019s main holiday. The day was once devoted primarily to private remembrances of the wartime victims that are in almost every Russian family, and many mourners here still pay visits to cemeteries to pile flowers on the graves of relatives.\n\nBut in 2008, Putin revived military parades through Red Square \u2014 they had ended after the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 \u2014 and every year since, the celebrations have grown more elaborate. Red banners, gold stars and the hammer-and-sickle emblem of the Soviet Union have festooned Moscow\u2019s streets in recent days.\n\nSo too have the black-and-\n\norange St. George\u2019s Ribbons that are a czarist-era military decoration but were brought back in recent years to commemorate veterans. On Friday, they were fastened to nearly every lapel in the country, including Putin\u2019s. The ribbons, which have become deeply politicized as a symbol of Russian nationalism, have also been adopted by pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine.\n\nBefore his remarks Friday in Sevastopol, which lasted less than four minutes, Putin reviewed sailors of the Black Sea Fleet, using a small white naval vessel to salute a line of Russian warships in turn. After he finished going down the line, dozens of fighter jets streaked across the sky.\n\nOnly a handful of states have recognized Crimea\u2019s annexation, and Putin\u2019s visit to soil that most countries in the world still consider legally Ukrainian drew immediate condemnation from the Obama administration, NATO and others.\n\n\u201cSuch a visit will only serve to fuel tensions,\u201d said National Security Council spokeswoman Laura Lucas Magnuson.\n\nIn Tallinn, Estonia, NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told reporters that \u201cfrom my knowledge, the Ukrainian authorities haven\u2019t invited Putin to visit Crimea, so from that point of view his visit to Crimea is inappropriate,\u201d the Associated Press reported.\n\nThe Ukrainian Foreign Ministry called the trip a \u201cgross violation of Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty\u201d in a statement.\n\nPutin was not the only Russian official asserting an expansive vision of Russian borders on Friday, with Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin visiting a Victory Day parade in Transnistria, the breakaway region of Moldova. Pro-\n\nRussian separatists in Ukraine have said they want to unite a band of territory from Transnistria to Odessa to eastern Ukraine in a new Kremlin-allied state of Novorossiya.\n\nThe holiday came amid escalating violence in eastern Ukraine that threatens to worsen within days. There was street-by-street fighting in the industrial port city of Mariupol on Friday, and a planned Sunday independence referendum organized by pro-Russian separatists could worsen the situation further, provoking a Russian invasion.\n\nThis week, Putin appeared to seek conciliation when he called for the referendum to be postponed. But the softer tone lasted only a day, after which Putin presided over massive military exercises that appeared designed to spotlight his country\u2019s resurgent hard power, with missiles streaking across Russia and rockets raining down on target ranges.\n\nAnd the loosely organized bands of separatists in eastern Ukraine quickly decided that they would proceed with the referendum anyway \u2014 in part, some said, because momentum was behind them.\n\nNatasha Abbakumova contributed to this report.", "tags": "set([])", "title": "Putin, marking Crimea annexation, lays claim to historic mantle"}
