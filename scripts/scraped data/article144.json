(Liveleak via AFP/Getty Images)\n\nOn March 25, a serious jihadist entered an Internet cafe in the northeastern Syrian town of Idlib. The hovel was all but empty. Rockets boomed in the background. He settled before a computer and accessed Skype. Then this English man named Abu Sumayyah al-Britani, who arrived in Syria one year ago and has since joined the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), began his interview with a radio podcast program called the \u201cISIS Show.\u201d\n\nOn the other end of the connection, sitting in Atlanta, was a young American journalist named Jonathan Lee Krohn. Followed on Twitter by some of the United States\u2019 most prominent journalists and academics, Krohn today runs the program and operates the Twitter handle \u201c@Jihadistuff.\u201d\n\nBritani\u2019s voice, smooth and sonorous, is tinged with his British roots. He said he had at first not wanted to attend the show, but later relented because it furthered an ISIS program \u201cwe have where we teach civilians about Islam.\u201d\n\nDespite that ostensible purpose, the first question brought Britani back to his European roots. The 2014 Champions League Final had just finished, and Krohn asked him about soccer.\n\n\u201cOooohh, you\u2019re right!\u201d Britani exclaimed, shedding in an instant months of warfare. \u201cYou know what, I haven\u2019t watched football for 10 months! Before I used to support Manchester United, but as I grew older I didn\u2019t see the attraction.\u201d He then confessed that many ISIS fighters were fans of Barcelona and Real Madrid.\n\nThe interview, cited by the Christian Science Monitor and called \u201csurreal\u201d by MSNBC\u2019s Christopher Hayes, exposed one of the lesser-scrutinized aspects of ISIS\u2019s march toward Baghdad. Challenging many Western stereotypes, the faces behind the masks of thousands of the jihadists fighting to overthrow the Iraqi and Syrian regimes are, in fact, Western.\n\nThe Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), an al-Qaeda splinter group that has seized a huge chunk of northern Iraq, is led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, a relatively unknown and enigmatic figure. (The Washington Post)\n\nSources: The Soufan Group, official estimates from each country. Graphic: Tobey \u2013 The Washington Post.\n\nAccording to academic and intelligence experts, the number of Westerners who have journeyed to the region \u2014 and become militarized and radicalized \u2014 has surged in the past year from hundreds to as many as 3,000. \u201cA lot are young, often teenagers, and a fair percentage of those arriving from non-Muslim majority countries are converts to Islam,\u201d wrote Richard Barrett of the Soufan Group, an intelligence organization. \u201cThese and others who share their faith commonly express their motivation as a religious obligation to protect fellow Muslims from attack.\u201d\n\nHis report, among the most thorough on the issue, found that people from at least 81 countries joined the civil war in Syria. The majority of fighters come from Arab countries, he wrote, but they also represent the European Union, the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nThe presence of young Western militants in Iraq and Syria signals a profound generational divide between ISIS and the older and now-diminished al-Qaeda. \u201cAl-Qaeda\u2019s greatest achievement was the 9/11 attacks, but that was 13 years ago,\u201d wrote Haverford associate professor Barak Mendelsohn in Foreign Affairs. \u201cMany of today\u2019s jihadis were young children at the time,\u201d and don\u2019t have much loyalty to the aging movement.\n\nOne of the clearest signs of the change can be found on social media. ISIS and other modern, more radical groups deploy a savvy, unerringly millennial social media strategy that combines Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and Mideast networks such as Dawn. The images are a mishmash of cats, guns and surreal hashtags.\n\n\u201cBrothers out jogging this morning,\u201d Abu Fulan al-Muhajir wrote on Jan. 29. \u201c#JihadFitness.\u201d Or on Jan. 30: \u201cSunset in Shaam, seen through my #Glock #NoFilter #NoMakeUp #NaturalBeauty\u201d\n\nSunset in Shaam, seen through my #Glock. #NoFilter #NoMakeUp #NaturalBeauty pic.twitter.com/hMyjqX9HbC \u2014 Abu Fulan al-Muhajir (@Fulan2weet) January 30, 2014\n\n\u201cMany thinks I\u2019m British or from Britain,\u201d he tweeted last September. \u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019m from Europe. That\u2019s all you guys need to know.\u201d\n\nGroups such as ISIS are particularly welcoming to foreign fighters, even those who don\u2019t speak Arabic or are without military training, the Soufan Group found. Westerners simply arrive one day, ask for a gun, and get one.\n\nOne Islamist \u201cdescribed a Swedish couple that had driven independently to Turkey and then joined a humanitarian convoy to Idlib,\u201d the Soufan Group report said. \u201cSpeaking in broken Arabic, the Swedish man had said that he had come for \u2018Jihad\u2019 and wanted a gun. He was provided with an AK-47, and his wife with a pistol. The Swedish man was a 22-year-old convert to Islam, his wife was 21.\u201d\n\nOur lil friend at home here.

Why leave the relative safety of a Western nation for militancy?\n\nThe reasons are legion. The French have called their jihadists \u201cdisaffected, aimless and lacking a sense of identity or belonging,\u201d Barrett wrote. \u201cPresumably people are seeking a greater purpose and meaning in their lives.\u201d There\u2019s also the \u201cdesire to witness and take part in a battle prophesized 1,400 years ago.\u201d\n\nTheir commitment to jihad on social media, experts say, attracts fresh recruits. Like Abu Sumayyah al-Britani, who went on the \u201cISIS Show,\u201d other Western fighters answer questions on sites such as ask.fm, Tumblr and Kik. They often portray their life as warm and important. They \u201creassure and address the fear of the unfamiliar,\u201d Barrett said. \u201cFor example there are many postings of fighters with pet kittens.\u201d\n\nMy puppacita astutely pointing out that dogs wag, cats wage jihad pic.twitter.com/HWzGny7Bf3 \u2014 Bridget Johnson (@Bridget_PJM) May 31, 2014\n\nBut their online identities also convey unfathomable brutality. One British militant posted a picture of his \u201cbrother Abu B of ISIS\u201d posing beside a stack of decapitated heads. Another Western fighter wrote on Twitter: \u201cGot these criminals today. Insha\u2019Allah will be killed tomorrow. Cant wait for that feeling when U just killed some1.\u201d\n\nOther Western militants end up dead. A Floridian died in May in a suicide bombing in Syria. Then two European ISIS members died in more suicide bombings, according to an ISIS announcement. One of them, a Frenchman, \u201cimmigrated to [Syria] days after converting to Islam, and then to Iraq, seeking martyrdom in the cause of Allah,\u201d the ISIS announcement said. A 21-year-old Brit, who swore \u201cwe can\u2019t accept enemies of Allah,\u201d was also killed this year.\n\nThe trend, which experts contend will deepen despite the mounting casualties, demonstrates the sway ISIS and other radical groups in Syria and Iraq have over some young Muslim Westerners. And now, with ISIS\u2019s recent gains in land and newfound wealth, the attraction may be even more powerful.\n\n\u201cAs money and manpower breed success, success will breed more success,\u201d Haverford\u2019s Barak Mendelsohn wrote. \u201cISIS\u2019s popularity will likely rise among radicals, and that will translate into more funding and volunteers for the group.\u201d", "positionLabels": ["defensive"], "politicalLabels": ["neutral"]}
