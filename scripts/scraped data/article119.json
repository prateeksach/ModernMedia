Foreign Web sites that distribute American-made entertainment and counterfeit products, like fake pharmaceuticals, are \u201cstealing our profits, they\u2019re stealing our jobs and they may be endangering the health of Americans,\u201d said Mr. Smith, a Republican from San Antonio.\n\nHe introduced the Stop Online Piracy Act in October to tackle the problem, but the bill has received a cold reception in Mr. Smith\u2019s home state.\n\nTechnology companies and business advocates in Texas agree that cyber crimes are a problem, but they contend that Mr. Smith\u2019s bill would cause greater economic damage, particularly to Texas\u2019 growing technology sector. And they say that online pirates could find ways to evade the law. Rackspace, Facebook and eBay, which have received economic incentives from the state to create jobs in Texas, are among the companies opposing the bill.\n\n\u201cIn the name of policing the online theft of intellectual property, key lawmakers are pushing a cure that\u2019s worse than the disease,\u201d Lanham Napier, the chief executive of Rackspace, a Web hosting business, wrote on the company\u2019s blog in December.\n\nPhoto\n\nExisting United States laws \u2014 used by copyright holders and law enforcement authorities to remove copyrighted or illegal content from the Internet \u2014 do not apply to foreign Web sites that operate outside the jurisdiction of American courts. To effectually shut down a foreign site engaging in illegal activity, the Stop Online Piracy Act, known as SOPA, would allow a court to order domestic companies to cut financial ties and block American customers\u2019 access to the site.\n\nThe bill has bipartisan support from a majority of the House Judiciary Committee, for which Mr. Smith is chairman, and is likely to pass out of committee when Congress reconvenes late this month. Mr. Smith said there was no language in the bill that would harm American businesses.\n\n\u201cUnless Rackspace is a foreign Web site primarily dedicated to illegal activity, it\u2019s not going to affect them or Facebook or any of the others,\u201d he said.\n\nThe technology industry strongly disagrees.\n\nEd Black, the chief executive of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, said the bill would fundamentally change technology companies\u2019 relationships with customers.\n\n\u201cThe harm is it ruins the business models for companies,\u201d Mr. Black said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want companies in a free society to act as secret police.\u201d\n\nIf the current bill passes, a plaintiff could obtain a court order without giving the defendant notice.\n\nA foreign Web site accused of breaking United States law would have 48 hours to request an appeal of the court\u2019s decision. If it does not appeal, American companies would have five days to obey the court order or face liability for enabling illegal activity.\n\nGoogle and Yahoo would be required to remove hyperlinks to the accused Web site in search results, PayPal and Visa would have to stop payment transactions on the site, and Google AdWords would have to discontinue advertisements. (All of those companies oppose the bill.)\n\nInternet service providers and companies like Rackspace would be required to block American users from accessing the Web site, or, as Mr. Napier put it in his blog post, \u201ccensor their customers with little in the way of due process.\u201d\n\nRackspace estimates that a quarter of the business it conducts with its more than 160,000 customers is overseas. Its headquarters is in an area of San Antonio just outside Mr. Smith\u2019s district, though he represents many of the 2,300 employees who work there.\n\nDespite the outcry, Mr. Smith stands behind the bill, which he said would protect Texans against intellectual property theft. Mr. Smith also pointed to Austin as a \u201cripe target\u201d because of its thriving music and film industries.\n\n\u201cThere is an imbalance in the degree to which intellectual property rights are protected online,\u201d said Chris Castle, a lawyer who represents musicians in Austin and supports SOPA.\n\nHe said Texans would benefit from a more clearly defined set of property rights, because the bill would encourage investment in legitimate Internet businesses that can profit from legally distributing artists\u2019 work. SOPA would force American companies and individuals to take responsibility for promoting criminal activity.\n\nThe bill faces opposition from fellow conservatives in Mr. Smith\u2019s home state and elsewhere. Gov. Rick Perry does not support the bill, nor does the conservative business advocacy group Americans for Job Security.\n\nThe measure would force technology companies to divert resources they could spend on innovation, job growth and marketing for \u201ccompliance with this new regulatory regime,\u201d said Stephen DeMaura, the president of Americans for Job Security. The extra spending on legal counsel would hurt hundreds of technology companies in Texas, he added, and especially harm start-ups and small businesses.\n\nOrganizations and people opposed to SOPA say the bill would \u201cnuke\u201d high-tech companies in Mr. Smith\u2019s district, and they accuse Mr. Smith of representing the interests of the entertainment industry over his constituents.\n\nAccording to Opensecrets.org, which is run by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit that tracks money in politics, the majority of Mr. Smith\u2019s campaign financing, $59,300 in this year\u2019s election cycle, has come from the entertainment industry.\n\nBut Opensecrets also reports that Mr. Smith has received $392,995 from the entertainment industry and $387,440 from the technology industry since 1998 \u2014 a small difference over all.\n\nThe technology industry remains convinced that its views were under-represented at a committee hearing on the bill and that pirates would find ways to evade the measure\u2019s provisions. Federal lawmakers are trying to move the bill quickly, Mr. Black said, without conducting extensive economic studies or consulting technical experts on cybersecurity.\n\n\u201cYou would at least hope that there would be an attempt to hear out all stakeholders,\u201d Mr. Black said, \u201cso there could be a consensus of understanding where there\u2019s common ground and where there are different views to try to bend.\u201d", "positionLabels": ["defensive"], "politicalLabels": ["liberal"]}
