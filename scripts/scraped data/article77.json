Asylum-seeker.\n\nNow, the fugitive National Security Agency contractor appears to have found a new role: Product pitchman.\n\nIn recent interviews and speeches at tech conferences, where he appeared remotely via Google Hangout, Snowden has endorsed several privacy and security tools -- whether the product's makers wanted his help or not.\n\nLast week, Snowden told The Guardian that consumers should avoid the cloud storage service Dropbox, which he said was \"hostile to privacy,\" and instead use a lesser-known competitor, SpiderOak, because it makes it harder for law enforcement to obtain stored content.\n\nAt the South by Southwest conference in March, Snowden recommended that people use Tor, a software that allows people to use the Internet anonymously. He also touted the encryption service Pretty Good Privacy, or PGP, and Open WhisperSystems, a project that built an app for encrypting text messages.\n\nIn a crowded market where security companies often claim their products are \u201cNSA-proof,\u201d an endorsement from Snowden can be a boon to a lesser-known startup, giving it added credibility and free publicity. But some companies have learned that being good enough for Snowden can also bring unwanted scrutiny.\n\nSnowden is currently living in temporary asylum in Russia while facing theft and espionage charges in the United States for disclosing details of the NSA surveillance program to media outlets.\n\nThere\u2019s no sign he has been paid for his recent product plugs, but some say Snowden could find a lucrative new career by positioning himself as a trusted privacy expert who makes money touting tech products. Snowden also hinted last week at a technology conference that he may start developing privacy tools himself.\n\n\u201cAt some point he's going to have to make a living,\u201d said John Pescatore, director of emerging security trends at the SANS Institute, a cybersecurity training organization. \u201cThat is probably what\u2019s really going on here.\u201d\n\nEthan Oberman, co-founder of SpiderOak, said Monday that he has never met Snowden and his endorsement last week came as a \u201ccomplete and total shock.\u201d Over the weekend, the number of people signing up for SpiderOak\u2019s services \u201cincreased dramatically,\" he said.\n\nSnowden's endorsement \u201cis not something we asked for or expected, but it\u2019s certainly a wonderful validation of what our team has been working on for the last seven years, and I\u2019m very thankful for that,\u201d Oberman told HuffPost.\n\nDropbox, for its part, has responded to Snowden\u2019s comments by saying that \u201csafeguarding our users\u2019 information is a top priority\u201d and the company has \u201cmade a commitment in our privacy policy to resist broad government requests.\"\n\nBut some companies have found that being associated with Snowden has its downsides. When FBI agents learned that Snowden had used Lavabit\u2019s secure email service, they requested passwords and encryption keys for all of its customers. Lavabit\u2019s owner, in turn, shut down the service instead of handing over that information.\n\nWhen Snowden was photographed last summer with a sticker on his laptop supporting the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group, it was \u201cboth an exciting moment and a scary moment,\u201d said Dave Maass, an EFF spokesman.\n\n\u201cWe were suddenly tied to this large scandal because of a sticker,\u201d Maass said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know who he was. We were suddenly in the middle of the story.\u201d\n\nSnowden \u201cis a controversial figure,\u201d and some businesses might not want him endorsing their products, Maass added.\n\n\u201cThere are people who don\u2019t like him who are going to associate him with that software,\u201d Maass said.\n\nPescatore said Snowden's endorsements would likely have little effect on any company\u2019s bottom line. That\u2019s because the general public is not so concerned with government surveillance that they are willing to adopt privacy tools that can be cumbersome. SpiderOak, for example, is unable to reset passwords, even if a person forgets his or her login information.\n\n\u201cSmall companies will get publicity, but as far as him changing adoption of these technologies, I don\u2019t see it happening,\u201d Pescatore said.", "tags": "set(['Most Popular on HuffPost'])", "title": "Edward Snowden's New Role"}
