{"content": "Israeli President Reuven Rivlin attends consultations, with representatives of parties elected to parliament (Knesset) last week, at his residence in Jerusalem on March 22, 2015, to hear who they would recommend as prime minister. In Israel, it is not necessarily the leader of the largest party who forms the next government and becomes the premier, but the one who can form a working coalition, preferably with a majority of at least 61 -- in this case, Netanyahu. AFP PHOTO/MENAHEM KAHANA ( | MENAHEM KAHANA via Getty Images\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) \u2014 Israeli President Reuven Rivlin said Sunday that the new Israeli government will have to serve \"all the citizens of Israel,\" and called for the country to begin a \"healing process\" after a stormy election campaign that highlighted deep internal divisions.\n\nRivlin serves a mostly ceremonial role and has positioned himself as a unifier since taking office last year. One of his few actual powers is choosing the person with the best chances of putting together a coalition government after elections. Throughout a close election campaign it seemed he would have a crucial role to play after the vote but a resounding victory by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party has made his considerations mostly moot.\n\nOn Sunday, Rivlin began meeting with all the parties in parliament to hear their recommendations before he officially tasks Netanyahu.\n\nEitan Cabel, a senior leader of the center-left's Zionist Union, which captured 24 seats to Likud's 30, told the president they had \"no intention\" of being part of a coalition. Meanwhile the Joint List, a union of Arab parties, told the president they had no recommendation.\n\n\"We see in Benjamin Netanyahu a dangerous person, he is dangerous to democracy,\" Joint List leader Ayman Odeh said.\n\nRivlin also met Sunday with Likud. He was scheduled to talk Monday with centrist parties Yesh Atid and Kulanu.\n\nIn a last-ditch attempt to spur his supporters to the polls last week, Netanyahu warned that Arab citizens were voting \"in droves\" and endangering years of rule by his right-wing Likud Party. The comments drew accusations of racism from Israeli Arabs and a White House rebuke.\n\nAlluding to the uproar, Rivlin told Likud representatives that the emerging government will have to serve \"all the citizens of Israel, Jews and Arabs.\"\n\n\"We have been through a stormy and passionate election period \u2014 this is the time to begin a process of mending and healing in Israeli society,\" he said.\n\nBy winning 30 seats in the 120-member parliament, Netanyahu's Likud looks to have a relatively easy time putting together a 61-seat majority along with its nationalist and religious allies.", "tags": "set(['Most Popular on HuffPost'])", "title": "Israeli President Calls For Healing After Divisive Election"}
