Here are six apps that are worth checking out. Hide Caption 1 of 7 7 photos Vainglory \u2013 While initally only for iPad, Vainglory, with its massively multiplayer gameplay designed specifically for touchscreens, will be a natural on the sizable iPhone 6 Plus when it rolls out. In fact, Apple used the forthcoming game to demo the iPhone 6's graphical capabilities at the rollout earlier this month. It will begin its rollout in October in southeast Asia, New Zealand and Australia and is expected to be available globally by December. Hide Caption 2 of 7 7 photos Snapseed \u2013 The iPhone 6's 8-megapixel camera doesn't have the big numbers of some of its competitors, but it's getting high marks from early reviewers for new features like faster auto-focus and the ability to take high-resolution panorama shots. Snapseed is a great photo editing tool. It has all the fun Instagram-style features like funky filters and frames, but combines them with an extensive, easy-to-use set of tools for brightness, sharpness, cropping and other editing. Hide Caption 3 of 7 7 photos Kindle \u2013 OK, odds are you've already got the Kindle app for your phone and tablet book-reading. But Amazon has jumped on the iOS 8 bandwagon quickly with a list of new features. The Kindle Today widget lets you keep up to three books front-and-center for easy reading. They also added the ability to copy and paste text from books you're reading and a quick translation app. Hide Caption 4 of 7 7 photos Swype \u2013 For the first time, Apple is allowing apps that retool the keyboard on the iPhone, and there are several good ones to choose from. Among other customization tools, Swype is best known for letting users drag their finger from letter to letter to type instead of hunting and pecking, and it's been a big hit among Android users. Apps like Fleksy and Swiftkey also are worth a look -- all three are either free or offer free trial periods. Hide Caption 5 of 7 7 photos Asphalt 8: Airborne \u2013 While you're waiting for Vainglory, you can get your gaming fix with the latest version of what's widely considered among the best mobile driving games around. Developers have already optimized \"Asphalt 8\" for iOS 8 (appropriately enough), taking advantage of the new phones' added graphics and processing power. It's mighty pretty and is going to look great on the bigger phones. Hide Caption 6 of 7 7 photos 1Password \u2013 It's getting harder and harder to keep up with all our passwords, not to mention to ignore news about big data breaches by hackers. 1Password tries to help by creating really tricky passwords for your various accounts, then letting you access them with one, presumably simpler one, via the app. It's already been updated for the new iOS 8 operating system, including integration with Apple's Touch ID fingerprint security. The basic version is also free now. Hide Caption 7 of 7 EXPAND GALLERY\n\nJust Watched What in the World: Privacy on Google replay More Videos ...

Concerned that the revelations will damage their businesses, particularly in foreign markets, the companies have taken a more public role in pushing back on the surveillance programs.\n\nYahoo, which fought a losing court battle against some surveillance requests, recently won a fight to make public secret court documents detailing that battle. The company used the information to tout its efforts to protect the privacy of its customers.\n\nThe FBI director said he understood the privacy concerns in the wake of Snowden. But he noted that the FBI sometimes has an urgent need to access data, such as in cases of kidnappings or terrorism.\n\nComey said he supports the idea that the FBI should have a warrant from a judge to take a look into someone's closet, or smartphone, but added he couldn't support \"the notion someone would market a closet that would never be open.\"", "tags": "set([])", "title": "FBI concerned about Apple, Google encryption"}
