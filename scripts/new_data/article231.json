{"content": "IF the public needed another reason to be cynical about New York politics, the \u201ctoughest gun law in the nation\u201d \u2013 passed by the Legislature at Gov. Pataki\u2019s urging last week \u2013 is as good as it gets.\n\nThe new law is not the toughest in the nation \u2013 gun-crime-ridden Washington, D.C., possesses that dubious distinction.\n\nAnd, more significantly, the new law \u2013 despite the hype from election-conscious politicians and their gullible media allies \u2013 isn\u2019t likely to have much, if any, impact on gun crimes in New York.\n\nThat\u2019s not just the view of pro-gun forces. It is, in fact, the view of many important officials in Pataki\u2019s own administration, as well as in the Legislature, where the final version of the new law \u2013 watering down the governor\u2019s original proposal \u2013 was drafted.\n\n\u201cNo new firearms are outlawed\u201d by the new law, says a confidential briefing paper prepared for internal state Senate consumption. \u201cNeither the federal law, nor the new state law, apply to assault weapons lawfully possessed prior to Sept. 14, 1994.\u201d\n\nTranslation: Far from banning so-called \u201cassault weapons,\u201d as Pataki and dozens of Democratic and (politically nervous) suburban GOP lawmakers have contended, the new law bans no guns at all.\n\nIt merely puts the existing federal ban \u2013 on post-1994 semi-automatic military look-alike guns falsely called \u201cassault weapons\u201d \u2013 into state law.\n\nWhat about Pataki\u2019s much-vaunted \u201cgun DNA\u201d program, which he said \u201cwill make New York a national leader in digitized ballistics tracking\u201d? In fact, the newly approved legislation is not what the governor started out seeking.\n\nWhen Pataki breathlessly unveiled his anti-gun proposals on national television last March, he urged a law forcing gun makers to record the supposedly tell-tale \u201cDNA\u201d markings gun barrels leave on fired bullets.\n\nBut that provision was removed by lawmakers concerned about the requirement\u2019s questionable value and potential high cost.\n\nThe new law does require manufacturers to provide the state with a spent shell casing so that the primer mark \u2013 caused by the striking of the firing pin \u2013 can be digitally recorded.\n\nPutting aside the fact that most serious gun crimes in New York involve guns purchased out of state \u2013 and therefore not subject to the new state requirement \u2013 changing the shell casing\u2019s \u201cDNA\u201d is easy. \u201cAll the criminal has to do is change the firing pin,\u201d notes the NRA\u2019s Albany lobbyist, Chris McGrath.\n\nThe legislation also requires new guns in New York to be sold with supposedly child-resistant trigger locks. But there\u2019s no requirement that the locks be used.\n\nAnd the law closes the gun-show \u201cloophole\u201d which let citizens purchase rifles and shotguns without undergoing a federal background check \u2013 much like a citizen can now do by purchasing a rifle or shotgun through the local Want-Ad Digest.\n\nBut that \u201cloophole\u201d was of increasingly reduced significance, because many embattled gun-show sponsors have recently imposed such a standard themselves.\n\nLast week, Pataki claimed the new law would prevent \u201c18- and 19-year-olds hanging around school yards\u201d from grabbing a gun and shooting someone.\n\nHow? It does ban those under 21 from obtaining a pistol permit to own a handgun. But anyone who has ever tried to obtain a pistol permit knows how difficult the licensing process is. How many 18- and 19-year-olds have been granted such permits in recent years, and how many engaged in criminal activities?\n\nA good, and legitimate, question to be asked of someone seeking to take away an existing legal right.\n\nBut Pataki administration officials confess they just don\u2019t have the answer.\n\nIf all this starts to have an \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d quality to it \u2013 well, welcome to Albany, 2000, a \u201cthrough the looking glass\u201d world if there ever was one.\n\nThis is, after all, the Albany where a conservative Republican governor, Pataki, metamorphizes into a Cuomo-like tax-and-spend liberal in just a few months.\n\nIt\u2019s a setting where a conservative Republican Senate Majority Leader, Joseph Bruno, who once denounced the homosexual lifestyle, has become a gay-rights champion and the moving force behind new \u201chate crimes\u201d laws.\n\nIt\u2019s a state Capitol that watched in amazement last month as dozens of left-wing liberal \u201creformers\u201d fought efforts to bring small \u201cd\u201d democracy to the Assembly\u2019s Democratic Conference.\n\nAnd, above all, it\u2019s a place which \u2013 even as we enter the 21st century \u2013 continues to resist the encrouchments of such \u201cmodern\u201d values as candor, honesty and openness.\n\nFredric U.
