{"content": "Earlier this month \u2014 right between Groundhog Day and Valentine\u2019s Day \u2014 Senator John Cornyn of Texas introduced a bill that would allow people from states with lax gun laws to carry their concealed weapons all around the country.\n\nThe goal, Cornyn said in a press release, is to treat local gun permits \u201clike drivers\u2019 licenses.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis operates more or less like a driver\u2019s license,\u201d he told a reporter for The Hill. \u201cSo, for example, if you have a driver\u2019s license in Texas, you can drive in New York, in Utah, and other places subject to the laws in those states.\u201d\n\nThis is perfectly reasonable, except for the part about gun permits being anything whatsoever like drivers\u2019 licenses. If a citizen from Mississippi shows his driver\u2019s license to someone in Connecticut, the Connecticut person has good reason to presume that the licensee can, um, drive. It\u2019s not a perfect system \u2014 witness the fact that there are many, many licensed drivers in America who have successfully parallel parked only one time in their entire life. But, still, no matter what state it comes from, a driver\u2019s license generally signifies a certain level of accomplishment when it comes to the basics of stopping, starting and steering.\n\nOn the other hand, a permit to carry a concealed weapon from Mississippi is concrete proof of the owner\u2019s ability to fill out an application. In Virginia, you can take an online course. You can get a permit from Florida without ever living in Florida, although you definitely do have to send $112 to the State Department of Agriculture.\n\nIn some states, you can be pretty certain that anyone with the legal right to carry a concealed weapon has been checked out carefully. In others, not so much. In 2007, The Sun Sentinel in Florida found that in a six-month period, more than 1,400 people who had pleaded guilty or no contest to felonies had been awarded concealed carry permits, along with 216 people with outstanding warrants, 28 people with active domestic violence injunctions against them, and six registered sex offenders.\n\nThe Cornyn bill would set a national bar at the lowest denominator.\n\n\u201cThe situation in Florida is dire enough on its own. But this law would present a danger to the rest of us because of Florida\u2019s abhorrently low standards,\u201d said Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. \u201cThink about this in terms of states\u2019 rights.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019d think that states\u2019 rights would be a winning argument. However, as with so many, many things in this world, states\u2019 rights is a theory that people only like when it\u2019s going to get them something they already want.\n\nIn many crowded cities, gun safety means there\u2019s almost nobody carrying but the cops. But it\u2019s impossible to keep that kind of order when people are roaming the streets waving out-of-town gun permits, which local police frequently have no way to verify.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a nightmare for New York law enforcement,\u201d said Senator Charles Schumer of New York. \u201cIn 20 states you can have a repeated history of mental health police visits and you can get a gun. You can have a domestic violence record. In many states, people subject to emergency orders of protection can be allowed to carry.\u201d\n\nCornyn\u2019s bill has been the top priority of groups like the National Rifle Association for years. That is, in part, because their base is irritated about not being able to drive around the country with a handgun in the glove compartment.\n\nHowever, I suspect another part of the equation is that the gun lobby is running out of causes to rally the troops. Some states have already pretty much legalized everything. Once you\u2019ve made it O.K. to carry a gun onto a playground, you\u2019ve just about come to the end of the road. The N.R.A. doesn\u2019t want to recruit members by arguing for Texans\u2019 right to wave a pistol around the small appliance department at Target. It wants a big, meaty challenge \u2014 like fighting for looser gun regulation in states where the populace doesn\u2019t want looser gun regulation.\n\nNobody doubts that the House of Representatives would pass a bill like Cornyn\u2019s. (Really, just call them; they\u2019ll come in and do it before dinner tonight.) The Senate has been more resistant, but, in 2013, the same proposal came within three votes of passage. And this is not an issue where minds are changed by an invigorating debate.\n\n\u201cYou say: \u2018Look, maybe this works in the rural parts of your state but it doesn\u2019t work in Times Square,\u2019 \u201d said Schumer. \u201cThey\u2019re not even open to the argument.\u201d\n\nNow, with the new Republican majority, it\u2019ll be extremely hard to keep a bill from being sent to the president. He could always veto it. Unless, of course, it was tied to some crucial, desperately needed measure.\n\n\u201cThis is awful, awful, awful,\u201d said Schumer.\n\nMaybe our best hope is that Congress will do what it does best and fail to pass any legislation whatsoever for the rest of the year.", "topic": "Gun Control", "politicalLabel": "Liberal", "organization": "New York Times", "biasLabel": "Biased", "title": "A Gun on Every Corner", "yellowLabel": "Not Yellow", "tags": "set([])", "opinionLabel": "Opinion Article"}
