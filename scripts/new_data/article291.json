Like brewing coffee in the morning, it\u2019s expected and blends in with the mundane backdrop of the office. The divisiveness of the gun debate, like many political discussions online, is deeply emotional with people on all sides convicted in their beliefs. But online, the debate has given way to a culture that accepts harassment as a form of rhetoric.\n\n\u201cThis behavior is tolerated by the pro-gun movement and it\u2019s not right, but unfortunately it\u2019s something we have to go through,\u201d Everitt said of the misogynistic, racist and \u201cinsurrectional\u201d threats he\u2019s encountered while working as a gun violence prevention advocate.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to get guys who don\u2019t get their way on policy issues making threats and that\u2019s kind of the point we\u2019re at,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing these guys can do to intimidate me. But other people have been scared away from doing the work.\u201d\n\nApp Wars\n\nOnly one person\u2019s full address was released on the Gunfree app, and it belonged to Brett Stalbaum, an associate visual arts professor for the University of California, San Diego, who specializes in digital aesthetics. It appears the main reason the app surfaced was retribution for one that he made.\n\nStalbaum, whose work address and phone number were listed, created a gun safety app called \u201cGun Geo Marker,\u201d which was released in the Google Play Store in 2013, lets local communities anonymously note places where guns are at risk of being misused, such as where one can openly carry a firearm.\n\nCREDIT: AppsByAMC\n\n\u201cMy project is a pro-Second Amendment project but it doesn\u2019t align with the [extreme] guns rights dogma,\u201d Stalbaum said. \u201cThe best way to preserve gun rights is to be responsible. Open carry in a Taco Bell is not responsible.\u201d\n\nStalbaum said he has been harassed in the past for his activist work, receiving death threats, emails, and phone calls at work. He monitored the Gunfree app out of intrigue but never tried to get it taken down because \u201cwriting code is a form of free speech\u201d and doing so would go against his stronger values of open expression.\n\n\u201cGun Geo Marker was never a doxxing or online harassment app,\u201d he said, there was never any personally identifying information and has a hyper-local focus. But the retaliatory nature of Gunfree, he said, seemed as if the developer thought as much.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because [the developer] is disingenuous or just paranoid. [Gun Geo Marker] was so people could discuss places that might not be safe for their kids.\u201d\n\nGoogle removed the controversial Gunfree Geo Marker after the Fast Company story gained traction. In a statement to ThinkProgress, a Google spokesperson wrote:\n\n\u201cWhile we don\u2019t comment on specific apps, we can confirm that our policies are designed to provide a great experience for users and developers. That\u2019s why we remove apps from Google Play that violate those policies.\u201d\n\nBut as quickly as it was taken down, the app has been reincarnated as Gun Free GeoMarker Mk-I and then removed again by Google. Though in its second life, there were no details in the Google Play Store on what the app does, just a vague descriptor and screenshots used to showcase the previous app version.\n\nYou will have to install and run it to see what\u2019s in it.\n\nNote: The screenshots are not accurate.\n\nBefore you complain and report, install it and run it.\n\nNote: If you have the previous, now suspended app, that app will become useless by April 1st as the map will no longer work.\n\nCREDIT: AppsByAMC\n\nThose who downloaded the new app were automatically prompted to uninstall the original app and then greeted by a long message from the app\u2019s developer, AppsByAMC. The message outlines why the first app was created and the frustrations with a perceived lack of civility online in the guns rights and gun violence prevention debate.\n\nGunfree\u2019s developer claimed that people on the gun violence prevention side have called for public attacks on gun carriers, made violent threats, encouraged suicide and promoted doxxing or swatting, when an anonymous tipster sends the police to raid an address. The developer also gave Stalbaum an ultimatum, saying he won\u2019t upgrade the app if Gun Geo Marker is decommissioned.\n\nCREDIT: AppsByAMC\n\nA Culture Of Harassment\n\nShannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense, told ThinkProgress she has seen more than her share of harassment since starting her gun violence prevention group. Watts admits that her information is easy to find online because she didn\u2019t anticipate being a public figure.\n\n\u201cWhen I started this Facebook page the day after Sandy Hook, I was truly, truly shocked to be exposed to this underbelly of America that I honestly had no idea existed,\u201d Watts said of the death and of sexual violence threats she received after getting involved in the guns rights debate.\n\n\u201cCalls to my home, emails, texts to my phone, people driving around the cul de sac around my home because my address was online,\u201d all within 24 hours of putting up the page, she said. Moms Demand Action For Gun Sense initially declined to be interviewed for this story to focus on the security and safety of its volunteers, at least one of whom was listed on the app.\n\nBut even with her experiences, Watts was unfazed by the app\u2019s existence or that her contact information was outed. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that will scare me more than losing a child. Nothing. No insult, no threat,\u201d Watts said. \u201cIf you\u2019re threatening people, you\u2019re not on the right side of history.\u201d\n\nWatts said she regularly gets death threats mailed to her home, and her family including her children, also have been harassed. She has called the police when people showed up to her door but there was only so much they could do.\n\n\u201cMy address was easily accessible. My phone number was easily accessible. My kids\u2019 names were easily accessible. I definitely wasn\u2019t as locked down as I should have been on social media,\u201d Watts said.\n\n\u201cWhen things like this happen, it isn\u2019t as shocking to me because I\u2019m used to it. But the fact that someone would go through all this trouble to put this information into an app\u2026it\u2019s a form of bullying.\u201d\n\nOnline harassment happens frequently with women and other marginalized groups \u2014 youth, people of color, and people in the LGBT community \u2014 bearing the brunt of it. Social media companies and law enforcement alike have failed to manage or address it in an effort to balance free speech and safety concerns.\n\nLegally, hateful speech can be vile and obscenely offensive and still be protected under the First Amendment unless that threatening speech poses a real and imminent danger to the person being harassed.\n\nThe internet allows people to say things out loud that they ordinarily wouldn\u2019t say in public, and say it with a virtual megaphone that reaches the eyes and ears of online users both locally and abroad.\n\nThe removal of those barriers and physical limitations to spreading messages to an audience has made it harder to discern, which of those troubling and violent threats could put someone in imminent danger versus someone blowing smoke on the internet.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy enough to block or mute people who are just being irritating or obnoxious,\u201d Watts said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a whole different situation when you threaten someone\u2019s life or threaten to harm them sexually. Those are things that are not tolerated outside of social media, and to tolerate them on social media really just allows the problem to continue and worsen.\u201d\n\nCan Online Threats Be Taken Seriously?\n\nThe Supreme Court has taken up the issue in a case where a man, Anthony Elonis, served jail time for threatening to kill his wife in graphically violent prose on Facebook.\n\nThe case has potentially broad implications and if the Court rules in favor of free speech, it could make it harder to hold harassers accountable for what they say online and, in turn, allow people to speak more freely online as long as they do not have truly malicious intent to carry out their threats. A ruling in the other direction could allow online harassment to be prosecuted unless a \u201creasonable person\u201d doesn\u2019t find the statements threatening.\n\nWith the ease of rapid communication, those threats add up and to do anything about it, victims have the added burden of determining which ones are worth reporting to the police.\n\nOne common strategy is to minimize your digital footprint and always report the most egregious threats to police and keep a record, but that simple advice doesn\u2019t provide much comfort.\n\n\u201cHow do you tell the difference between I\u2019m going to kill you bitch and someone who will show up at your house?\u201d Watts, from Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense, asked. \u201cAnd in this situation, you\u2019re going to assume that most of your critics are armed,\u201d she said with a wry laugh.\n\n\u201cI have no useful or practical advice,\u201d Gun Geo Marker creator Stalbaum said, \u201cI assume if someone wanted to hurt me they wouldn\u2019t be sending an email or calling or sending messages from an IP address the police can trace.\u201d\n\nZack Ford contributed to the reporting of this story.", "topic": "Gun Control", "politicalLabel": "Neutral", "organization": "ThinkProgress", "biasLabel": "Not Biased", "title": "App Lets Gun Enthusiasts Track Down Gun Control Advocates' Home Addresses", "yellowLabel": "Not Yellow", "tags": "set(['NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION', 'First Amendment', 'True Threats', 'Gun Control', 'free speech', 'IMMIGRATION', 'POLICE BRUTALITY', 'Second Amendment', 'CRIMINAL JUSTICE', 'CALIFORNIA', 'Gun Violence Prevention'])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
