{"content": "For all the attention Jonathan Gruber is getting for admitting the architects of ObamaCare were banking on \u201cthe stupidity of the American voter\u201d and a deliberate \u201clack of transparency\u201d to muscle the president\u2019s signature law through Congress, no one needed his videos to know that.\n\nAll you had to do is look at the administration\u2019s changing storyline once parts of the bill began landing in the Supreme Court. Because the only way for the court to uphold the law was by confirming the president wasn\u2019t being truthful when he was selling it to us.\n\nRemember the individual mandate and how the White House swore it wasn\u2019t a tax? When it came to the high court, it was upheld \u2014 on the grounds that it was a tax.\n\nDitto for the contraceptive mandate and the Little Sisters of the Poor, a Catholic order of nuns who care for the elderly poor and refused to sign a form authorizing an insurer to start providing coverage for sterlization, contraceptive and abortion-inducing drugs. All along, the White House said the form is just a piece of paper \u2014 yet it\u2019s been fighting the sisters all the way to the Supreme Court to force them to sign.\n\nThe latest case involves a provision that grants subsidies only to people who bought health coverage \u201cthrough an exchange established by the state.\u201d The ObamaCare architects\u2019 intent was to provide strong incentives for states to set up these exchanges. Only 14 states did. So now, defenders of ObamaCare say it was just a typo.\n\nIn short, it\u2019s not just that ObamaCare was built on lies. It\u2019s that it requires new lies to get it past the Supreme Court.", "topic": "Obamacare", "politicalLabel": "Conservative", "organization": "New York Post", "biasLabel": "Biased", "title": "Lies, damned lies\u2026Obamacare", "yellowLabel": "Yellow", "tags": "set(['Barack Obama', 'ObamaCare', 'Jonathan Gruber', 'Editorial'])", "opinionLabel": "Opinion Article"}
