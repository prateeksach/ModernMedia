Every session, GOP-controlled legislatures enact dozens of new restrictions on the procedure, and test the boundaries of how far states can limit access to abortion while Roe v. Wade still stands.\n\nBut by now, there are already so many anti-abortion laws in place that conservative states have been forced to get creative. The areas of the country that serve as testing grounds for new abortion restrictions have recently enacted laws to go after reproductive health care in brand new ways.\n\nCREDIT: ThinkProgress/Dylan Petrohilos\n\nKansas, for instance, just became the first state in the country to ban a specific type of abortion procedure that\u2019s known in the medical community as Dilation and Evacuation, or \u201cD&E.\u201d In a closed-door ceremony on Tuesday, flanked by large photos of fetuses, Gov. Sam Brownback (R) handed a significant victory to abortion opponents by signing the measure into law. The National Right to Life Committee, the right-wing group that drafted the legislation, said in a statement that \u201cthis law has the power to transform the landscape of abortion policy in the United States.\u201d\n\nAlthough D&E is the most common way to perform a surgical abortion in the second trimester \u2014 and is actually the method endorsed by researchers from the World Health Organization \u2014 abortion opponents have been working to cast the procedure as barbaric, claiming that it \u201cdismembers\u201d an unborn child.\n\nJulie Burkhart, who operates the South Wind Women\u2019s Center in Wichita, has called the new law \u201cdangerous,\u201d arguing that it \u201cdictates to qualified physicians the scope of their practice and implies that certain medical treatments that physicians may use would lead to criminalization.\u201d\n\nThe tactic evokes a very similar political fight over so-called \u201cpartial birth abortion\u201d \u2014 another misleading phrase to describe a surgical abortion procedure that was coined by National Right to Life. That effort targeted a process called Intact Dilation & Extraction, or \u201cD&X,\u201d and was very successful at stoking emotional outrage about pregnancy terminations that occur after the first trimester. In the 1990s, dozens of states rushed to ban D&X procedures, and the issue eventually made its way up to the Supreme Court.\n\nReproductive rights proponents are concerned that the same thing may be about to play out with D&E \u2014 particularly because similar \u201cdismemberment\u201d bans have also been introduced in Missouri, Oklahoma, and South Carolina so far this session.\n\nAnd \u201cdismemberment\u201d isn\u2019t the only example of anti-abortion lawmakers forging ahead into new territory. This month, laws approved in Arizona and Arkansas will require doctors to tell women about an unproven method of \u201creversing\u201d an abortion \u2014 something that has enshrined junk science into law in a new way.\n\nThe idea that injecting the hormone progesterone after the first dose of pills involved in a medication abortion can \u201creverse\u201d the procedure has become popular among abortion opponents. But medical experts say there\u2019s nothing to back up the theory, and doctors shouldn\u2019t be required to recommend it to their patients.\n\n\u201cClaims of medication abortion reversal are not supported by the body of scientific evidence, and this approach is not recommended in ACOG\u2019s clinical guidance on medication abortion,\u201d the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) concludes in a fact sheet about Arizona\u2019s new law. One practicing OB-GYN called the policy \u201cdownright offensive,\u201d pointing out that doctors wouldn\u2019t push an unsure patient into having a medical abortion in the first place.\n\nIn some ways, this legislative session is playing out exactly as experts in the field of women\u2019s health issues expected. After the 2014 midterm election handed significant victories to abortion opponents, observers predicted that GOP-controlled states would waste no time figuring out how to tighten their abortion laws even further.\n\nNonetheless, reproductive rights supporters are frustrated with the wave of recent laws that dictate how abortion providers should do their jobs with little regard for the best evidence in the medical field.\n\n\u201cPoliticians are not medical experts, yet politicians have written these reckless laws as part of a broader effort to end access to safe, legal abortion, plain and simple,\u201d Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said in a statement this week. \u201cAcross the country, legislators are pushing laws that are opposed by the leading medical organizations for the sole purpose of shutting down women\u2019s health centers and stopping a woman from getting an abortion,\u201d Jennifer Dalven, the director of the ACLU\u2019s Reproductive Freedom Project, added.", "topic": "Abortion", "politicalLabel": "Liberal", "organization": "ThinkProgress", "biasLabel": "Biased", "title": "The New Extremes Of The Anti-Abortion Movement", "yellowLabel": "Yellow", "tags": "set(['ABORTION', 'Abortion', 'FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION', 'REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS', 'OBAMACARE', 'SCIENCE', 'Reproductive Rights'])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
