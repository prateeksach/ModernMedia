{"content": "HOUSTON \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday denied a Justice Department request to lift a temporary hold on President Barack Obama\u2019s executive action that sought to shield millions of immigrants from deportation.\n\nUS District Judge Andrew Hanen refused to stay his Feb. 16 decision that granted a preliminary injunction requested by 26 states. The US government wants the injunction lifted \u2014 allowing Obama\u2019s action to proceed \u2014 while it appeals Hanen\u2019s ruling to the 5th US Circuit Court in New Orleans.\n\nThe Justice Department has already asked the 5th Circuit to lift the injunction. The appeals court was scheduled to hear arguments on whether the injunction should be lifted on April 17.\n\nThe coalition of 26 states has filed a lawsuit to overturn Obama\u2019s executive actions, which would spare from deportation as many as 5 million people who are in the US illegally. The states, led by Texas, argue that the action is unconstitutional and would force them to invest more in law enforcement, health care and education. The injunction is intended to stall Obama\u2019s actions while the lawsuit progresses through the courts.\n\nJustice Department attorneys argue that keeping the temporary hold harms \u201cthe interests of the public and of third parties who will be deprived of significant law enforcement and humanitarian benefits of prompt implementation\u201d of the president\u2019s immigration action.\n\nObama announced the executive orders in November, saying a lack of action by Congress forced him to make sweeping changes to immigration rules on his own.", "topic": "Immigration", "politicalLabel": "Neutral", "organization": "New York Post", "biasLabel": "Not Biased", "title": "Request to lift hold on Obama immigration action denied", "yellowLabel": "Not Yellow", "tags": "set(['Justice Department', 'executive actions', 'Barack Obama', 'Immigration'])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
