{"content": "The pros are getting into pot.\n\nFounders Fund, the $2 billion San Francisco venture capital firm run by Silicon Valley stars including Peter Thiel, co-founder and former CEO of PayPal, is investing in Privateer Holdings, a marijuana company that owns several pot-related brands.\n\nThe companies declined to disclose the size of the investment Thursday, but described it as a \u201cmultimillion-dollar\u201d participation in a $75 million fundraising effort by Privateer. The deal had been rumored last year.\n\nPrivateer, based in Seattle, owns the Canadian medical marijuana producer Tilray and the pot information service Leafly. It is also launching a brand of marijuana and products with the family of Bob Marley called Marley Natural.\n\nFounders Fund partner Geoff Lewis, who is leading the firm\u2019s investment in Privateer, said in an interview that he believes the broader legalization of marijuana is inevitable.\n\n\u201cPublic sentiment is there, and it crosses political lines,\u201d Lewis said.\n\nThere are 23 states that allow the use of marijuana for medical purposes and Colorado has legalized its recreational use.\n\nThere has been some pushback, however, despite growing public support. The states of Nebraska and Oklahoma have filed a lawsuit seeking to overturn the legalization of marijuana in Colorado, saying that they are being overrun with marijuana from across their borders.\n\nAnd Founders Fund does not expect a quick turnaround on its investment in Privateer, Lewis said. Founders is investing in Privateer because it believes Privateer can eventually establish mainstream brands that will be recognized and trusted as marijuana becomes legal and socially acceptable, he said.\n\nPrivateer was founded in 2010 and has previously landed $22 million in funding.\n\nBefore the announcement Thursday, Privateer\u2019s funding came mostly through wealthy individuals and investment offices that steer private family funds.\n\nPrivateer CEO Brendan Kennedy thinks the Founders investment will lead to more professional investment in marijuana-related businesses and help advance the push toward legalization.\n\n\u201cOne of the important milestones for this business is having access to capital, and significant capital,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be a lot of people who wake up (now) and realize they need to look at this industry just as they have looked at other emerging industries around the world.\u201d\n\nFounders Fund was an early investor in Facebook and has current investments in SpaceX, Spotify and Airbnb.", "topic": "Marijuana Legalization", "politicalLabel": "Neutral", "organization": "New York Post", "biasLabel": "Not Biased", "title": "Peter Thiel wants to be a weed dealer", "yellowLabel": "Not Yellow", "tags": "set(['Privateer Holdings', 'Peter Thiel', 'Marijuana', 'Bob Marley'])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
