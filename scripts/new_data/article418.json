{"content": "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. \u2014 An Arkansas judge on Friday struck down the state\u2019s ban on gay marriage, opening the door for gay couples to wed.\n\nPulaski County Circuit Judge Chris Piazza said the 2004 amendment\u2019s definition of marriage as allowable only between a man and a woman is unconstitutional and violates the rights of same-sex couples.\n\nThe ruling came nearly a week after state Attorney General Dustin McDaniel announced he personally supports gay marriage rights but that he will continue to defend the constitutional ban in court.\n\nMcDaniel\u2019s office is expected to quickly appeal Piazza\u2019s ruling to the Arkansas Supreme Court.\n\nThe 2004 constitutional amendment was passed with the overwhelming support of Arkansas voters.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court last year ruled that a law forbidding the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages was unconstitutional. Since then, lower-court judges have repeatedly cited the Supreme Court decision when striking down some of the same-sex marriage bans that were enacted after Massachusetts started recognizing gay marriages in 2004.\n\nSince late last year, federal judges have ruled against marriage bans in Michigan, Oklahoma, Utah, Virginia and Texas, and ordered Kentucky, Ohio and Tennessee to recognize same-sex marriages from other states.\n\nIn all, according to gay-rights groups, more than 70 lawsuits seeking marriage equality are pending in about 30 states. Democratic attorneys general in several states \u2014 including Virginia, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Oregon and Kentucky \u2014 have declined to defend same-sex marriage bans.\n\nMcDaniel, a Democrat in his final year as attorney general, is the first statewide elected official in Arkansas to support marriage equality. The state\u2019s other top Democrats, including Gov. Mike Beebe and U.S. Sen. Mark Pryor, have said they still oppose gay marriage rights.\n\nThe plaintiffs argue that their rights to due process and equal protection can\u2019t be superseded, even by a state constitutional amendment. Attorneys for the state have argued that an amendment to the state constitution can\u2019t itself be deemed unconstitutional.\n\nA group of same-sex couples have also challenged Arkansas\u2019 ban in federal court.", "topic": "Gay Marriage", "politicalLabel": "Neutral", "organization": "New York Post", "biasLabel": "Not Biased", "title": "Arkansas judge strikes down ban on gay marriage", "yellowLabel": "Not Yellow", "tags": "set(['Arkansas', 'Civil rights', 'Gay Rights', 'Gay marriage'])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
