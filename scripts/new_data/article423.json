{"content": "Being gay is \u201cabsolutely\u201d a choice \u2014 and prison proves it, potential presidential candidate Ben Carson said Wednesday.\n\n\u201cBecause a lot of people who go into prison go into prison straight \u2014 and when they come out, they\u2019re gay,\u201d the former neurosurgeon, who has said he\u2019s considering a 2016 run as a Republican candidate, told CNN in an interview.\n\n\u201cSo, did something happen while they were in there? Ask yourself that question.\u201d\n\nThe issue came up when CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo asked if federal courts should get involved if people of a state unanimously vote for a law that infringes on the rights of a minority group.\n\n\u201cLike happened very often with slavery, and like many would argue is happening now with people who are gay,\u201d he said.\n\nBut that comparison didn\u2019t sit right with Carson, who insisted \u201cpeople have no control over their race,\u201d but they do make choices about their sexuality.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time he\u2019s made controversial comments on same-sex marriage.\n\nAt the Iowa Freedom Summit in January, he joked that gay couples shouldn\u2019t demand wedding cakes from bakers who don\u2019t want to do business with them \u2014 because they might end up poisoned.\n\n\u201cWhat I have a problem with is when people try to force people to act against their beliefs because they say, \u2018They\u2019re discriminating against me,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cSo they can go right down the street and buy a cake, but no, let\u2019s bring a suit against this person because I want them to make my cake even though they don\u2019t believe in it. Which is really not all that smart because they might put poison in that cake.\u201d", "topic": "Gay Marriage", "politicalLabel": "Neutral", "organization": "New York Post", "biasLabel": "Not Biased", "title": "Prison shows being gay is a choice: GOP presidential hopeful Ben Carson", "yellowLabel": "Not Yellow", "tags": "set(['LGBT', 'ben carson', 'Same-sex marriage'])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
