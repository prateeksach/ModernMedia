{"content": "The speeding, pot-smoking teen behind the wheel of a gruesome Long Island car crash that killed four of his buddies said, \u201cI hate myself for what I\u2019ve done,\u201d before he was sentenced Tuesday to five to 15 years in prison.\n\n\u201cI will have to live with myself for the rest of my life, knowing I killed four young men who were like brothers,\u201d said Joseph Beer, 19, of Queens.\n\nBeer was the lone survivor after a car he was driving on the rain-slicked Southern State Parkway without a license and under the influence of marijuana plowed into a tree in Malverne in October 2012.\n\nProsecutors said he was driving above 110 mph. Beer was operating the car with only a learner\u2019s permit, and was not authorized to drive without a licensed adult in the vehicle.\n\nBeer, in court, begged the families of his childhood friends \u2014 Neal Rajapa, 17, Darian Ramnarine, 18, Peter Kanhai, 18, and Christopher Kahn \u2014 for forgiveness, but received none.\n\n\u201cEventually I will be able to forgive you, but it will take a long time,\u201d Hemant Kanhai, Peter Kanhai\u2019s uncle, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cYou took someone away from us that we loved dearly, and you tore a hole in our family that can never be mended.\u201d\n\nHe chided Beer for attending his nephew\u2019s funeral and wake, even though he was not invited.\n\nBeer pleaded guilty in July to the top count of aggravated vehicular homicide.\n\nA jury had been deadlocked on the charge, but a month later Beer admitted his guilt to spare his friends\u2019 families a second trial.\n\nAs Beer approached Exit 17N on the parkway, he lost control of his car and skidded more than 200 feet across all three lanes of traffic, where the car left the road and hit a tree.\n\nBeer was seen wandering in a daze, using light from his cellphone to look for survivors. He suffered minor injuries.\n\n\u201cJoseph Beer purposely smoked marijuana with the intent of driving and caused the deaths of the passengers who trusted him to get them home safely,\u201d Nassau County DA Kathleen Rice said.\n\n\u201cThe deaths of these four young men were violent and senseless. It was not the road\u2019s fault and it was not the first time Joseph Beer had engaged in this unspeakably reckless behavior.\u201d", "topic": "Marijuana Legalization", "politicalLabel": "Neutral", "organization": "New York Post", "biasLabel": "Not Biased", "title": "Teen sentenced in 2012 wreck that killed his four friends", "yellowLabel": "Not Yellow", "tags": "set(['Car Crashes', 'Marijuana', 'Long Island'])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
