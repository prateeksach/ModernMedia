In the morning, he officially took the gavel as chairman of the Senate\u2019s Environment Committee. In the afternoon, he took the Senate floor for a long speech about how human-caused climate change is fake.\n\nHere\u2019s the video:\n\nIn sum, the speech has everything. References to the oft-debunked \u201cClimateGate\u201d stolen e-mail \u201cscandal\u201d, a poster of a Time Magazine cover from 1974 claiming an ice age is coming, and multiple references to former Vice President Al Gore. It has a mention of a survey of weather-casters who think global warming is caused by natural variation, but does not mention that weather-casters are not climate scientists. It even includes the claim that the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \u201cstarted\u201d the whole idea that climate change is happening, even though the idea was conceived about 200 years ago.\n\nThe video above actually begins a couple minutes in to Inhofe\u2019s speech, with a quote from Richard Lindzen, a former MIT professor and one of the most-cited voices of scientists who think global warming is fake. Lindzen, an atmospheric physicist, has often been characterized as having contrarian scientific opinions. He has also said that the evidence that cigarettes cause lung cancer is not \u201cso strong that one should rule that any questions were out of order.\u201d\n\nBehind Inhofe in the beginning of the video is a list of climate scientists \u2014 Lindzen included \u2014 who don\u2019t agree with the vast majority of climate scientists who say human-caused carbon emissions are contributing to climate change. Inhofe says he has compiled a list of 4,000 \u201crenowned scientists\u201d scientists who disagree (\u201cthis is all in my website,\u201d he said). Inhofe\u2019s list actually has 650 people, some of whom are television meteorologists, geologists, anthropologists, and even a man with no college degree.\n\nConversely, one of the most recent peer-reviewed studies on the state of climate science showed that out of 4000 abstracts from peer-reviewed papers published in the past 21 years that stated a position on the cause of global warming \u2014 97 percent of these endorsed the point that it was human-caused. In the video, Inhofe says this is \u201cjust not true.\u201d\n\nInhofe also criticizes climatologist Michael Mann\u2019s famous hockey stick graph, which displayed temperatures going back half a millennium, and cites the controversy it received as a reason to believe climate change is fake. He does not mention that the National Academy of Sciences vindicated the hockey stick graph in 2006 as good science, as have multiple other peer-reviewed studies since.\n\nIt\u2019s also worthwhile to point out that even if the hockey stick was wrong, even if it didn\u2019t exist, we would still have enough scientific evidence to prove climate change is real and caused by humans. \u201cClimate deniers like to make it seem like the entire weight of evidence for climate change rests on the hockey stick,\u201d Mann told the Atlantic in 2013. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not the case. We could get rid of all these reconstructions, and we could still know that climate change is a threat, and that we\u2019re causing it.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t expect this speech to be the end of climate denial in the Senate. Indeed, Inhofe ended his speech by promising more of it, citing his new position as head of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.\n\n\u201cNow I\u2019m back in that position so we\u2019ll have a chance to have hearings, and Mr. President, we\u2019re going to have hearings with prominent scientists to come in and talk about this thing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be there to be the truth-squad.\u201d", "topic": "Climate Change", "politicalLabel": "Liberal", "organization": "ThinkProgress", "biasLabel": "Not Biased", "title": "New Senate Environment Chair Gets His Gavel, Goes On Rant Arguing Climate Science Is A Hoax", "yellowLabel": "Yellow", "tags": "set(['CANADA', 'Climate Deniers', 'CLIMATE CHANGE', 'James Inhofe', 'Jim Inhofe', 'CALIFORNIA', 'Climate Change', 'RENEWABLE ENERGY', 'DROUGHT'])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
