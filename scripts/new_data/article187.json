Earlier this week, CNN reported that the couple will lose the employer-sponsored plan through the company, and speculated that Cruz would likely be in the market for a new health care plan.\n\n\u201cWe will presumably go on the exchange and sign up for health care and we\u2019re in the process of transitioning over to do that,\u201d Cruz told The Des Moines Register on Tuesday.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, each state now has an insurance marketplace where Americans can purchase plans if they don\u2019t already get coverage through their employer. Federal lawmakers and their staffers are required to enroll in these Obamacare plans, thanks to an amendment sponsored by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA).\n\nCruz told the Des Moines Register that \u201cmembers of Congress should not be exempt\u201d from Obamacare \u2014 which was the rationale behind Grassley\u2019s amendment \u2014 but reiterated his belief that the entire law should be repealed. He said that he believes the next president will get rid of health reform. \u201cThere are a fair number of Republicans in Washington and elsewhere who have quietly and privatively given up on that fight and I have not,\u201d he said.\n\nThis month, the health law marked its fifth anniversary and federal officials announced that it has extended coverage to more than 16 million previously uninsured Americans. The Department of Health and Human Services also announced that reforms under Obamacare helped hospitals save an estimated $7 billion last year.\n\nCruz, who once spent more than 21 hours filibustering funding for the health law, recently unveiled a bill that he says provides a viable alternative to Obamacare. He\u2019s proposing undoing the bulk of the law \u2014 including the state marketplaces, the tax subsidies to help people purchase plans, and the mandate to buy insurance \u2014 and allowing people to purchase insurance across state lines, which has been a long-time GOP proposal.", "topic": "Obamacare", "politicalLabel": "Liberal", "organization": "ThinkProgress", "biasLabel": "Not Biased", "title": "After Pledging To 'Repeal Every Word Of Obamacare,' Ted Cruz Admits He's Signing Up For Obamacare", "yellowLabel": "Yellow", "tags": "set(['ABORTION', 'SCIENCE', 'Obamacare', 'FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION', 'OBAMACARE', 'REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS', 'Ted Cruz'])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
