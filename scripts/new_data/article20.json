{"content": "GEORGETOWN, Texas \u2014 A 19-year-old Texas man who could face years in prison for making brownies laced with marijuana and hash oil said Wednesday he remains scared despite new evidence that his attorney believes should reduce the charges.\n\nA handful of pot legalization supporters welcomed Jacob Lavoro as he entered a Williamson County courthouse near Austin for the second time since his April arrest. He is accused of selling the brownies for $25 and is facing felony charges that carry stiff penalties, ranging from five years to life in prison.\n\nJack Holmes, Lavoro\u2019s attorney, told reporters after a brief hearing that new lab results show there was only 2.5 grams of marijuana\u2019s psychoactive ingredient, THC, in the brownies. Authorities have also said there was a separate jar that had 145 grams of hash oil.\n\nIn Colorado, where recreational marijuana is now legal, edible products are required to be easily divided into servings of 10 milligrams of THC \u2014 about the amount in a medium-sized joint.\n\nHolmes said the test results don\u2019t justify tough punishments but was doubtful of getting a break. Although neighboring Austin is a liberal haven in deeply conservative Texas, Williamson County has a long reputation of law and order, which came under national scrutiny in 2011 after an innocent man was freed after serving 25 years in prison.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m scared. Very scared,\u201d Lavoro said. \u201cI\u2019m 19 years old and still have a whole life ahead of me. Take that into account.\u201d\n\nFirst District Attorney Mark Brunner said Holmes was \u201cgrandstanding\u201d and that prosecutors are not trying to lock up Lavoro for the rest of his life. His office has offered Lavaro a plea deal to a lesser felony charge that would include no jail time if he stayed out of trouble.\n\nHolmes said they won\u2019t take the offer because they fear prosecutors would be overzealous if Lavaro missed so much as a mandatory meeting. Brunner said the county isn\u2019t trying to make some statement on the war on drugs and defendants take risks when they choose a trial over plea bargains.\n\n\u201cIf this was just some college kid experimenting in his friend\u2019s Easy-Bake Oven, with a reefer\u2019s worth of pot and a bunch of brownies, that\u2019d be different,\u201d Brunner said. \u201cThis man was trying to run a business, allegedly.\u201d\n\nHash oil is a controlled substance that carries much harsher state penalties than marijuana. The oil has higher concentrations of THC. It\u2019s in a penalty group with amphetamines and ecstasy.\n\nHolmes said he expects Lavoro to be formally indicted later this month. State District Judge Stacey Mathews set a key September hearing, when Holmes said he will argue that the charges should be dropped altogether over whether the search of Lavoro\u2019s apartment was lawful.", "topic": "Marijuana Legalization", "politicalLabel": "Neutral", "organization": "New York Post", "biasLabel": "Not Biased", "title": "Teen faces life in jail for making pot brownies", "yellowLabel": "Not Yellow", "tags": "set(['Marijuana', 'Texas'])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
