{"content": "Getting guns off the street is not enough to stop violent crime, a group of lawmakers said yesterday.\n\nYou have to stop the bullets, too.\n\n\u201cFor far too long we have ignored the relationship between bullets and gun crimes,\u201d state Sen. Eric Adams (D-Brooklyn), a former NYPD captain, said as he held a hollow-point slug. \u201cWe can no longer allow this item, this bullet, to be that silent partner.\u201d\n\nAdams said he was introducing legislation that would mandate the tracking of ammunition and force buyers to register the bullets they purchase.\n\nAdams was joined by state Sens. Malcolm Smith and Eric Schneiderman outside De Marco\u2019s restaurant in Greenwich Village, where a crazed gunman shot and killed a bartender last week before chasing down two auxiliary cops and murdering them in cold blood on the street.\n\nThe killer, David Garvin, 42, was shot to death moments later by police. He was carrying a bag with nearly 100 rounds of ammunition. Cops later seized another 100 rounds in his apartment.\n\nOne bill would permit the sale of bullets only to individuals who hold legal gun licenses that specify the type of ammunition being purchased. A second bill would require manufacturers to brand bullets sold in New York with a traceable code to help police track them during criminal probes.\n\n\u201cIf David Garvin did not have \u2013 as we believe he did not have \u2013 a permit for the gun he was carrying, he shouldn\u2019t be allowed to buy bullets,\u201d Schneiderman said.\n\ndan.kadison@nypost.com", "topic": "Gun Control", "politicalLabel": "Neutral", "organization": "New York Post", "biasLabel": "Not Biased", "title": "GUNS AREN\u2019T ENOUGH \u2013 POLS WANT BULLET CONTROL", "yellowLabel": "Not Yellow", "tags": "set(['Game of Thrones', 'Hillary Clinton', 'the masters', 'Chess', 'New York Yankees', 'NYPD'])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
