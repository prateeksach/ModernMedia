Joe Baca over the Democrat's record on guns and the environment.\n\nThis week, Bloomberg's super PAC launched TV ads against former congresswoman Debbie Halvorson, who has been highly rated by the National Rifle Association. Halvorson is among the Chicago-area candidates vying to replace Jesse Jackson Jr. in Congress. The special election for the House seat vacated by Jackson is April 9.\n\nSo far, the National Rifle Association remains the heavy hitter in the gun debate, spending more than $20 million on the 2012 elections through its various arms \u2013 including a political action committee.\n\nIts year-end PAC donations included a $4,000 contribution to the leadership PAC of Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., a report filed Thursday shows. He has said he opposes efforts to reinstate the assault-weapons ban. The NRA also contributed to debt retirement for several incoming House freshman, including Rep. Markwayne Mullins, R-Okla., donating $1,000 to his campaign.\n\nIn a recent statement, Mullins said President Obama was \"politicizing a national tragedy\" by pushing to ban high-capacity ammunition magazines and other gun restrictions following the Dec. 14 shootings in Newtown, Conn.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/WW5dWw", "positionLabels": ["critical"], "politicalLabels": ["neutral"]}
