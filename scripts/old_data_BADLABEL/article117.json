They plan to cross over the porous border and will \u201cimminently\u201d launch car bomb attacks. And the threat is so real that federal law enforcement officers have been placed at a heightened state of alert, and an American military base near the border has increased its security.\n\nAs the Obama administration and the American public have focused their attention on ISIS in recent weeks, conservative groups and leading Republicans have issued stark warnings like those that ISIS and other extremists from Syria are planning to enter the country illegally from Mexico. But the Homeland Security Department, the F.B.I. and lawmakers who represent areas near the border say there is no truth to the warnings.\n\n\u201cThere is no credible intelligence to suggest that there is an active plot by ISIL to attempt to cross the southern border,\u201d Homeland Security officials said in a written statement, using an alternative acronym for the group.\n\nPhoto\n\nDemocrats say opponents of President Obama are simply playing on concerns about terrorism as part of their attempt to portray Mr. Obama as having failed to secure the border against illegal immigration.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a longstanding history in this country of projecting whatever fears we have onto the border,\u201d said Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke, Democrat of Texas, who represents El Paso and other areas near the border. \u201cIn the absence of understanding the border, they insert their fears. Before it was Iran and Al Qaeda. Now it\u2019s ISIS. They just reach the conclusion that invasion is imminent, and it never is.\u201d\n\nAt a congressional hearing last week, Representative Jeff Duncan, Republican of South Carolina, pushed back strongly against the testimony of Homeland Security Department officials and Mr. O\u2019Rourke, saying they were ignoring a gathering threat.\n\n\u201cWake up, America,\u201d Mr. Duncan said before storming out of the hearing. \u201cWith a porous southern border, we have no idea who\u2019s in our country.\u201d\n\nBut counterterrorism officials say they are far more concerned that an ISIS militant will enter the United States the same way millions of people do each year: legally, on a commercial flight. Their efforts have focused on the more than 2,000 Europeans and 100 Americans who have traveled to Syria to fight alongside extremist groups, nearly all of them crossing over its unprotected borders. Without markings in their passports to show that they traveled to Syria, American border authorities have few ways of determining where they were and stopping them from entering the country.\n\nWarnings about the possibility of terrorists entering the United States from Mexico have been sounded in the past. During the 2012 presidential campaign both Rick Perry and Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee, said Islamic extremists working with countries in Latin America, including Mexico, posed a significant threat to the United States.\n\n\u201cWe know that Hamas and Hezbollah are working in Mexico, as well as Iran, with their ploy to come into the United States,\u201d Mr. Perry, the governor of Texas, said at a Republican debate in 2011. \u201cSo the idea that we need to have border security with the United States and Mexico is paramount to the entire Western Hemisphere.\u201d\n\nMr. Perry repeated his concerns in a speech last month at the Heritage Foundation in Washington in which he said that because the border was not secure, \u201cindividuals from ISIS or other terrorist states could be\u201d crossing into the United States. \u201cI think it\u2019s a very real possibility that they may have already used that,\u201d he said.\n\nIn late August, the conservative group Judicial Watch posted an article on its website about how ISIS was operating in the Mexican border city of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez and planning car bomb attacks.\n\n\u201cHigh-level federal law enforcement, intelligence and other sources have confirmed to Judicial Watch that a warning bulletin for an imminent terrorist attack on the border has been issued,\u201d the report said. \u201cAgents across a number of Homeland Security, Justice and Defense agencies have all been placed on alert and instructed to aggressively work all possible leads and sources concerning this imminent terrorist threat.\u201d\n\nJudicial Watch said intelligence officials had \u201cpicked up radio talk and chatter indicating that the terrorist groups are going to \u2018carry out an attack on the border.\u2019 \u201c It quoted a \u201chigh-level source\u201d saying that the attack was \u201ccoming very soon.\u201d\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke said that immediately after that report was posted he called the F.B.I. and Homeland Security Department. They told him they had no intelligence about such an attack. Mr. O\u2019Rourke said he spent the rest of his day arguing with members of the news media in Texas about why the Judicial Watch report was not a story. He largely failed to convince them, and the article was widely reported.\n\nTom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch, said the Obama administration had a history of looking the other way on national security threats, particularly ones involving the border.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama or his administration should acknowledge this dire threat on the border, whatever its political ramifications are for the debate on immigration,\u201d Mr. Fitton said.\n\nMr. Fitton said that the idea of ISIS coming across the border \u201cgoes against the narrative that the border is secure\u201d and that Americans \u201cdon\u2019t need to worry about illegal immigration.\u201d\n\nOn Fox News on Monday, a county sheriff in Texas said he had received reports that Qurans and Muslim clothing had been found on smuggling routes. He said that was evidence that Muslims had been smuggled into the United States.\n\n\u201cIf they show their ugly head in our area, we\u2019ll send them to hell,\u201d said the sheriff, Gary Painter, of Midland County. \u201cI would like for them to hit them so hard and so often that every time they hear a propeller on a plane or a jet aircraft engine that they urinate down both legs. When you do that, then you\u2019ve accomplished a lot.\u201d\n\nFox News itself has covered the threats in different ways. After senior administration officials testified at a Senate hearing last week about ISIS, an article on FoxNews.com about the testimony ran under the headline \u201cD.H.S. Confirms ISIS Planning Infiltration of U.S. Southern Border.\u201d An article on Fox News Latino about the same hearing had the headline: \u201cISIS Terrorists Not Sneaking Over U.S. Southern Border With Mexico, D.H.S. Officials Tell Congress.\u201d", "positionLabels": ["defensive"], "politicalLabels": ["liberal"]}
