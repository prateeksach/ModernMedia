Guests on Megyn Kelly\u2019s Fox News show spent 15 minutes airing objections to the president\u2019s comments.\n\n\u201cLest we get on our high horse and think this is unique to some other place, remember that during the Crusades and the Inquisition, people committed terrible deeds in the name of Christ,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cIn our home country, slavery and Jim Crow all too often was justified in the name of Christ.\u201d\n\nContinue reading the main story Video\n\nStill, the president went on to focus on the terrorism carried out under the guise of Islam, saying that the last few months have shown the degree to which faith can be \u201ctwisted and misused in the name of evil.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom a school in Pakistan to the streets of Paris, we have seen violence and terror perpetrated by those who profess to stand up for faith \u2014 their faith \u2014 professed to stand up for Islam, but, in fact are betraying it,\u201d he said, describing the Islamic State as \u201ca brutal, vicious death cult that, in the name of religion, carries out unspeakable acts of barbarism.\u201d\n\nBill Donohue, the president of the Catholic League, said in a statement that Mr. Obama was trying to \u201cdeflect guilt from Muslim madmen.\u201d He said the president\u2019s comparisons were \u201cinsulting\u201d and \u201cpernicious.\u201d\n\nMr. Gilmore said the comments go \u201cfurther to the point that Mr. Obama does not believe in America or the values we all share.\u201d\n\nThe White House had no comment on Thursday night about the criticism.\n\nIn his speech, Mr. Obama said the use of religion to justify violence and killings \u201cis not unique to one group or one religion.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a tendency in us, a sinful tendency, that can pervert and distort our faith,\u201d he said.\n\nThe talk of terrorism was the sharpest note in a speech that was otherwise a reflection on religion and humility, and it was Mr. Obama\u2019s latest effort to avoid branding recent violence by the Islamic State or those professing common cause with it as \u201cIslamic\u201d extremism. His team has said that doing so would play into the hands of terrorist organizations, legitimizing their message.", "positionLabels": ["factual"], "politicalLabels": ["liberal"]}
