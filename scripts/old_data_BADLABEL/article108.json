Putin resurfaced Monday after a 10-day absence from public view, looking healthy. (Sultan Dosaliev, Pool/Associated Press)\n\nMOSCOW \u2014 Even while Vladimir Putin was still mysteriously absent, Russian TV delivered a clear message for Russians and foreigners alike: Putin is firmly in charge, and ready to use his country\u2019s military power to safeguard the interests of Russia and Russians.\n\nA lavish 2 \u00bd-hour documentary on Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea aired late Sunday, and the United States was designated as the villain in what has mushroomed into the gravest crisis in East-West relations since the Cold War.\n\nIn an on-camera interview, the Russian president, who reappeared in public Monday following a still unexplained 10-day disappearance, accused the Americans of being the \u201creal puppet masters\u201d behind nationalist forces that overthrew Ukraine\u2019s former president and ushered in that country\u2019s current pro-Western government.\n\nFor an outside observer who was in Crimea at the height of the annexation crisis one year ago, the state-owned TV production was blatantly, sometimes surreally one-sided. The tone was set with its title: \u201cCrimea: The Road Home,\u201d with \u201chome\u201d in this case being the word Russians affectionately use for their country: Rodina, or Motherland.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin met with Kyrgyz President Almazbek Atambayev on Monday, according to footage from state tv. The meeting marked Putin\u2019s first public appearance in more than 10 days, following rumors of poor health. (Reuters)\n\nIt made some startling if unsubstantiated claims, like an alleged plot by Ukrainian nationalists to poison a reservoir where many Crimeans get their drinking water.\n\nIt skipped over the harsh treatment meted out to many who opposed the Russian takeover, including ethnic Ukrainian activists or members of the Crimean Tatar minority, some of whom have been killed, are missing or have been driven from their homes.\n\nThe only victims of alleged mistreatment or brutality granted airtime were pro-Moscow inhabitants of the peninsula or members of Ukraine\u2019s Berkut riot police who escaped to Crimea after the collapse of Viktor Yanukovych\u2019s presidency.\n\nCrimea State Prosecutor Natalia Poklonskaya, installed in office following the Russian takeover, struck a typical note. Bringing Crimea into Russia, which the U.S. and its allies have said violates treaty commitments made by the Kremlin, was the right thing to do, she said \u2014 and what\u2019s more, \u201cGod is on our side.\u201d\n\nOther pro-Moscow heroes showcased in the documentary included Soviet military veterans and bikers from the Night Wolves motorcycle club, with whom Putin has ridden on occasion.\n\nIf the recent history of the Black Sea peninsula was the documentary\u2019s nominal topic, its real star was the Russian leader, interviewed on an undisclosed date in a wood-paneled study as he sipped tea with Andrei Kondrashov, Russian state television\u2019s leading news anchor.\n\nRussia\u2019s advantage in the Crimea crisis, Putin bluntly told Kondrashov, was that he was in charge \u201cpersonally\u201d\u2014 guaranteeing that his subordinates gave the matter their utmost attention, he said.\n\nPutin\u2019s order to send troops into Crimea to neutralize Ukrainian forces apparently caught even his top lieutenants off guard. He said his defense minister ordered some soldiers in the first wave already en route to return, apparently because he believed the president had changed his mind.\n\n\u201cI had to ask him: \u2018Who allowed you to do that?\u2019 said Putin. The minister, Sergei Shoigu, quickly countermanded his own order, Putin said.\n\nPutin said it had been his personal decision to dispatch Russian forces to extract Yanukovych and bring him to safety in Russia; to deploy anti-ship missile batteries along Crimea\u2019s coast to deter any hostile action by the U.S. Navy; and even to bring Russia\u2019s nuclear arsenal to a state of alert if need be.\n\nThe Russian president did not explain why he ordered the deployment of troops without Russian insignia, or why authorities in Moscow denied at first their forces were involved. Instead, Putin said, the blame for the crisis in general lies in Washington.\n\nIt was \u201cour American partners and friends,\u201d said Putin, \u201cwho helped prepare the nationalists, they helped prepare the military units\u201d to take power in Ukraine. Such preparations, Putin charged, took place in western Ukraine, but also in the NATO nations of Poland and Lithuania.\n\n\u201cHow did our partners act?\u201d Putin asked. \u201cThey enabled the carrying-out of a coup d\u2019etat.\u201d\n\nPerhaps with an eye to improving Moscow\u2019s now icy relations with many Western countries and to quell concerns that Putin is itching for a fight, the documentary stressed that Russia\u2019s leader is no warmonger. When more hotheaded military experts sought a muscular confrontation with the West, Kondrashov reported, Putin refused, saying the Cold War was over and that the world didn\u2019t need a repeat of the Cuban Missile Crisis.\n\nPutin also said European countries had acted in Ukraine without realizing what they were doing \u2014 a distinction that may be intended to drive a wedge between Europe and the United States.\n\nRecalling his conversations with President Obama and other Western leaders during the Crimea crisis, Putin said he sternly told them he will do what it takes to defend what he views as Russia\u2019s vital interests.\n\n\u201cI told them openly that this is our historic territory,\u201d said Putin. \u201cRussian people live there, they are in danger, we can\u2019t abandon that.\u201d\n\n---\n\nDahlburg reported from Brussels.\n\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
