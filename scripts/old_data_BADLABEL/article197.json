By Monday night the White House had not responded.\n\nIn total, more than 20 petitions have been filed. One for Texas has reached the 25,000-signature threshold at which the White House promises a response.\n\n'Blatant abuses'\n\nThe last time states officially seceded, the US Civil War followed.\n\nMost of the petitions merely quote the opening line of America's Declaration of Independence from Britain, in which America's founders stated their right to \"dissolve the political bands\" and form a new nation.\n\nCurrently, the most popular petition is from Texas, which voted for Mr Romney by some 15 percentage points more than it did for the Democratic incumbent.\n\nThe text complains of \"blatant abuses\" of Americans' rights.\n\nIt cites the Transportation Security Administration, whose staff have been accused of intrusive screening at airports.", "positionLabels": ["defensive"], "politicalLabels": ["liberal"]}
