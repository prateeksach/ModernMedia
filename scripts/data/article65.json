Those users tweet from 545 to nearly 2,000 posts each day.\n\nMost of the accounts tweet in Arabic, with only about one in five using English. And each account has an average of about 1,000 followers, which is considerably higher than an ordinary Twitter user, according to Brookings.\n\nMost ISIL supporters were located within the territories where the group operates, as well as Saudi Arabia, and had created their accounts in 2014, the report found.\n\nWhile some analysts and policy-makers have argued for suspending ISIL-related accounts, the study questioned whether that would be effective at slowing the group.\n\n\u201cAccount suspensions do not have concrete effects in limiting the reach and scope of ISIS activities on social media,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe process of suspension does create certain new risks \u2026 they isolate ISIS supporters online.\"\n\n\"This could increase the speed and intensity of radicalization for those who do manage to enter the network, and hinder organic social pressures that could lead to deradicalization,\u201d the study added.\n\nAttempts to de-radicalize social media users will be most successful if they remain part of a mainstream platform such as Twitter, which contains a wide community and range of political, social and religious outlooks, the report argued.\n\n\u201cPrior to the advent of social media, Al-Qaeda training camps practiced cult-like techniques of indoctrination, which included cutting new recruits off from the outside world,\u201d the study said. \u201cWhile the barriers to outside engagement in a virtual environment are obviously far more porous, the segregation of ISIS\u2019s social network may create a smaller but similar effect.\u201d", "positionLabels": ["critical"], "politicalLabels": ["neutral"]}
