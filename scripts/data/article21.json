The video, with its arresting imagery and impressive production values, is designed to electrify the group's followers.\n\nThe fact that Abu Safiyya is described as being from Chile merely adds to what the authors hope is now the organisation's global appeal.\n\nIsis said the Islamic state would extend from Aleppo in northern Syria to Diyala province in eastern Iraq.\n\nAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the group said, would become the leader of the state and would be known as \"Caliph Ibrahim\".\n\nIn the recording, the rebels also demanded that all Muslims \"pledge allegiance\" to the new ruler and \"reject democracy and other garbage from the West\".\n\nWhat is a caliphate?\n\nAn Islamic state ruled by a single political and religious leader, or Caliph\n\nCaliphs are regarded by their followers as successors to the Prophet Muhammad and the leader of all Muslims\n\nFirst caliphate came into being after Muhammad's death in 632\n\nIn the centuries which followed, caliphates had dominion in the Middle East and North Africa\n\nThe last widely accepted caliphate was abolished in 1924 by Turkish leader Kemal Ataturk after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire\n\nThe Ahmadiyya sect of Islam has recognised a caliphate for the last century, but it is only this group that does so\n\nOn Sunday, Iraqi government jets struck at rebel positions and clashes broke out in various parts of Tikrit, witnesses and officials said.\n\n\"The security forces are advancing from different areas\", Lt-Gen Qassem Atta told journalists. \"There are ongoing clashes.\"\n\nTroops had reportedly pulled back to the nearby town of Dijla as Saturday's initial offensive met stiff resistance.\n\nThese refugees from Mosul are among many now sheltering at a camp in Iraqi Kurdistan\n\nAn Iraqi machine-gunner guards a highway west of Karbala, a Shia holy city\n\nThe heavy fighting over the two days caused many casualties on both sides, eyewitnesses and journalists told the BBC.\n\nInsurgents were reported to have shot down a helicopter and captured the pilot.\n\nMeanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called for the creation of an independent Kurdish state in response to gains made by Sunni insurgents in Iraq.\n\nIn a speech in Tel Aviv, he said the Kurds were \"a nation of fighters and have proved political commitment and are worthy of independence\".\n\nThe Kurds have long striven for an independent state but they remain divided between Syria and Turkey, Iran and Iraq.\n\nThe international community, including neighbouring Turkey and the US, remains opposed to the breakup of Iraq.", "positionLabels": ["factual"], "politicalLabels": ["neutral"]}
