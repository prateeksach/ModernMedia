Obama offered a plan, but not one that deals directly with some of the problems he will have to confront immediately.\" A Wall Street Journal opinion piece read: \"[Obama] said little during the campaign about his first term and even less about his plans for a second. Instead his strategy was to portray Mitt Romney as a plutocrat\u2026 it worked with brutal efficiency - the definition of winning ugly.\" Doyle McManus of the Los Angeles Times writes: \"If we're lucky, we will find that we elected a different Obama from the one who won four years ago - not just a grayer Obama but a wiser one too.\"\n\nReferring to the struggling economy, Mr Romney said now was not the time for \"partisan bickering and political posturing\", and that Republicans and Democrats must \"put people before politics\".\n\n\"I so wish that I had been able to fulfil your hopes to lead the country in a different direction but the nation chose another leader and so I join with you to earnestly pray for [Mr Obama] and for this great nation,\" he said.\n\nUnder the US constitution, each state is given a number of electoral votes in rough proportion to its population. The candidate who wins 270 electoral votes - by prevailing in the mostly winner-takes-all state contests - becomes president.\n\nOn Tuesday, the president held the White House by assembling solid Democratic states and a number of important swing states such as Colorado, Iowa, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Minnesota, Virginia and Wisconsin. His narrow victory in Ohio, a critical Mid-Western swing state, sealed the victory.\n\nIn other key ballots:\n\nReferendums in Maine, Maryland and Washington state approved same-sex marriage, while a measure in Minnesota to block gay unions failed\n\nColorado and Washington state voted to legalise recreational use of marijuana\n\nCalifornia voters rejected a proposal to abolish the death penalty\n\nIn a referendum, Puerto Ricans voted in favour of becoming the 51st US state, if Congress approves the move.\n\nBillions spent\n\nMr Romney won North Carolina and Indiana, both of which Mr Obama won in 2008, as well as the solid Republican states.\n\nBut he was unable to win in Ohio or other states needed to breach the 270 threshold.\n\nAlso on Tuesday's ballot were 11 state governorships, a third of the seats in the 100-member US Senate and all 435 seats in the House of Representatives.\n\nMr Obama's victory came despite lingering high unemployment - 7.9% on election day - and tepid economic growth.\n\nBut voters gave him credit for his 2009 rescue of the US car industry among other policy accomplishments, and rewarded him for ordering the commando mission that killed Osama Bin Laden in Pakistan last year.\n\nHe and Mr Romney, as well as their respective allies, have spent more than $2bn (\u00a31.25bn) - largely on adverts in swing states.", "positionLabels": ["factual"], "politicalLabels": ["neutral"]}
