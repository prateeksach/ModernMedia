Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida said in Tokyo on Saturday that the situation was unpredictable, NHK reported.\n\n\u201cAnything could happen,\u201d Kishida said. \u201cWe can't predict it at all. While preparing for every situation, I want to make every effort for Mr. Goto's release.\u201d Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is on standby to receive regular updates on the situation, NHK said.\n\nThe deadlock follows the passing of a Thursday deadline set by ISIL for the release of Sajida al-Rishawi, who was convicted of involvement in the 2005 bombings of three hotels in the Jordanian capital of Amman in an attack that killed 57 people. On Thursday, Jordan requested proof that its pilot is still alive in order to consider a prisoner exchange, but there has been no communication from ISIL since then.\n\nThe proof-of-life request from the Jordanian government followed the release on Wednesday of an audio recording in which a voice identifying itself as Goto conveyed ISIL\u2019s demand for Rishawi's release.\n\n\u201cIf Sajida al-Rishawi is not ready for exchange for my life at the Turkish border by Thursday sunset, 29th of January, Mosul time, the Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kassasbeh will be killed immediately,\u201d Goto said in an unverified audio message distributed by ISIL-linked Twitter accounts.\n\nJordan has offered, in principle, to swap Rishawi for the pilot, but ISIL has offered only to release Goto and spare the pilot\u2019s life. ISIL has not yet indicated that it is willing to release Kassasbeh. The Jordanian government has so far made no mention of Goto in its disclosures about the negotiations.\n\nISIL is also holding British photojournalist John Cantlie and an American woman captured last year in Syria while working for aid groups. U.S. officials have asked that the woman not be identified out of fears for her safety.\n\nISIL has suffered recent losses in airstrikes by a U.S.-led coalition. With global oil prices down sharply, its revenue from oil in the territory it controls in Iraq and Syria has likely dropped.\n\nThe group, which holds a wide stretch of territory in Iraq and Syria after months of intense fighting, is also funding its operations through extortion and other criminal activities. ISIL fighters recently released some 200 mostly elderly Yazidi hostages in Iraq, fueling speculation by Iraqi officials that the group did not have the money to care for them.\n\nAl Jazeera and wire services", "positionLabels": ["critical"], "politicalLabels": ["liberal"]}
