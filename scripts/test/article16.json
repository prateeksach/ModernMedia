And the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), beginning Wednesday in Washington, provides them with a perfect opportunity.\n\nIn 1992, Clinton set himself apart from left-wing identity politics by criticizing radical rapper Sister Souljah at Jesse Jackson\u2019s Rainbow Coalition. (Souljah had spoken on a panel hosted by the organization and had made provocative anti-white statements.)\n\nToday, much like Democrats in 1992, Republicans have an image problem with voters outside their base. Even as they control Congress, just as Democrats did in 1992, they\u2019ve lost the popular vote in five of the past six presidential elections. Growing portions of the electorate \u2014 minorities, millennials, the highly educated \u2014 are turning away from the GOP. While some of those constituencies vote at lower rates in midterms, Republicans are left at a disadvantage in presidential election years.\n\nRepublican leaders and pragmatic conservatives know this. That\u2019s why, in the wake of the 2012 election, the Republican National Committee committed itself to minority outreach and conservative pundits filled Fox News and the op-ed pages with calls to embrace immigration reform.\n\nBut when the House Republican leaders tried to actually start working on an immigration bill, they got nothing to show for it except a fearsome backlash that took out their own majority leader, Eric Cantor of Virginia, in a primary. Congressional Republicans, who fear the same fate, subsequently abandoned any reform effort. Their newest stunt is threatening to partially shut down the Department of Homeland Security unless the White House abandons its plans to soften deportation policy. Although this polls terribly, Vox.com\u2019s Matt Yglesias points out that Republicans did not pay a price for such unpopular moves in the 2014 midterms. But that\u2019s because the midterm electorate is whiter and more conservative than in presidential years. The Republicans keep damaging their brand among growing constituencies such as Latinos and paying the price in presidential years.\n\nThe RNC now blasts out regular statements demonstrating the party\u2019s impeccable multiculturalism. They celebrate Cinco de Mayo and the Lunar New Year (for Asian Americans), honor \u201cHistory Making Black Republican Trailblazers\u201d and commemorate Jewish American Heritage Month. But there are no leading Republican politicians offering any substantive moderation.\n\nThe Republican war on science is as intense as it has ever been: None of the party\u2019s prospective presidential contenders endorses action to address climate change, and most don\u2019t even accept the underlying science. This despite the fact that, according to a New York Times poll from last month, 66 percent of Americans and 48 percent of Republicans said they would be more likely to vote for a candidate who accepts climate science and supports policies to reduce carbon emissions. Two Republican presidential contenders, Chris Christie and Rand Paul, recently asserted that vaccinating children against highly contagious deadly diseases such as measles should be up to their parents. Paul even trotted out the discredited claim that vaccines cause autism.\n\nThe GOP approach to social issues also lags progress within its own party and especially outside it. Gay marriage has become widely accepted, even among likely Republican primary voters in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. But none of the Republican presidential contenders has backed it, or even called for passing the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, an enormously popular proposal to ban workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Being backward on gay rights, denying climate science and calling for mass deportations make Republicans unappealing to the very same groups that they must court. Young people and minorities are especially likely to support climate action and gay rights. Collectively, the GOP\u2019s retrograde positions and asinine rhetoric sends a message to cosmopolitan people that Republicans are at war with modernity.\n\nRepublicans who want to win the White House could benefit enormously in the general election from confronting their base and saying that they accept 21st-century standards of equality and scientific inquiry. And where better to do it than at CPAC? The annual conservative confab has come to epitomize conservative base politics in all its resentment, foolishness and bigotry. This is where Sarah Palin joked in 2013 that she has the \u201crack\u201d for her husband\u2019s \u201crifle\u201d and brought out an oversize soda to stick it to Mike Bloomberg. It also draws some exhibitors, attendees and panelists from the world of white nationalism. Would an acknowledgement of the reality of climate change impress the CPAC crowd? No \u2014 it would probably get booed. But it would generate positive headlines and impress moderate voters.\n\nOf course, no Republican who wants to win the primaries dares to cross the party\u2019s right wing. In 2012, Jon Huntsman tried running as the candidate who accepted the science of climate change and evolution and understood the dangers of breaching the debt ceiling limit. That won him some glowing profiles in mainstream magazines, but not a single RNC delegate. Much more effective was the path taken by Mitt Romney, who claimed at CPAC 2012 that he had been a \u201cseverely conservative\u201d governor of Massachusetts. Romney, the holder of an MBA and JD from Harvard and a former advocate of gay rights, abortion rights, health-care reform and even smart growth, abandoned all of that \u2014 along with his prior acceptance of climate science \u2014 to win grudging acceptance from the conservative movement. It worked well enough to win the Republican nomination, and to win a higher proportion of the white vote than George H.W. Bush did in 1988. But the electorate has changed, and so has the result of appealing only to white voters. Appealing to the CPAC voter might help win a primary, but a primary win doesn\u2019t do you much good if you alienate most of the population.\n\nUltimately, the right will have to get restless enough about wanting to get back into the White House to accept the compromises that the left did in 1992. It will probably take another loss or two. But if a Republican challenged the right to come around now and ended up winning the nomination, he or she would be a lot better off in November 2016.", "positionLabels": ["critical"], "politicalLabels": ["liberal"]}
