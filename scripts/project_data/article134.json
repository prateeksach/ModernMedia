{"content": "Congressional Republicans are in a tough spot. Funding for the Department of Homeland Security expires on February 27, but conservatives are demanding that any DHS funding bill also block President Barack Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration. That\u2019s unacceptable to Senate Democrats, who filibustered the legislation three times last week.\n\nAnd now we\u2019re stuck. Some Republican senators are urging their House colleagues to accept a \u201cclean\u201d funding bill that doesn\u2019t block Obama\u2019s unilateral actions, but that\u2019s unacceptable to House Republicans. \u201cThe House did its job,\u201d Speaker John Boehner said Wednesday. \u201cNow it\u2019s time for the Senate to do their work.\u201d No one is quite sure how this will end. \u201cI guess the lesson learned is don\u2019t put yourself in a box you can\u2019t figure out a way to get out of,\u201d Republican Senator Shelley Moore Capito said.\n\nThe exact outcome may be unpredictable, but this impasse wasn't.\n\nThink back two months ago, when Congress needed to reach an agreement to fund the entire government. Conservatives were still seething at the president for taking executive action on immigration and wanted to use the government funding deadline as leverage to enact concessions from Obama. Republican leadership, on the other hand, was terrified that another government shutdown would be a political disaster for the GOP, just as they regained full control over Congress. And, they argued, Republicans would have more leverage in the 114th Congress, having won the Senate in November. The compromise was to fund the government through the rest of the fiscal year\u2014with the exception of the Department of Homeland Security, which was funded only until February 27.\n\nConservatives weren\u2019t happy with the deal, but Boehner\u2019s job was safe. More importantly, the Republican leadership had limited the political downside of a potential shutdown. Now, it wouldn\u2019t be a full government shutdown, just one department. Given the Tea Party\u2019s fury at Obama, that was a huge victory for Boehner.\n\nBut even though the current impasse was the best case scenario for Republicans, they still are in a tough position. The practical effects of a DHS shutdown are relatively minor, since most of DHS\u2019s employees are classified as essential and thus would continue to work in the case of a shutdown. But the political implications of it are much worse. Obama can criticize the GOP for putting the U.S.\u2019s national security at risk. \u201cI can think of few more effective ways for Republicans to re-surrender national security as an issue to Obama than by taking the Department of Homeland Security hostage like this,\u201d The New Republic\u2019s Brian Beutler wrote in December. And that\u2019s exactly what Obama has done in recent weeks. As February 27 approaches, Obama and other Democrats will only amplify that message.\n\nRepublicans are already trying to avoid blame for a DHS shutdown. \u201cIf there\u2019s a shutdown, it wouldn\u2019t be because of us,\u201d Republican Senator Orrin Hatch said Tuesday. \u201cThe Democrats are filibustering it. I don\u2019t know how we get blamed for that this time.\u201d Hatch is right\u2014Democrats did filibuster the House-passed legislation on three separate occasions. But Republicans will probably take the blame. That\u2019s how the politics of the filibuster work. The minority uses it to obstruct legislation and the majority takes the blame. Americans know that Republicans control both chambers of Congress. They aren\u2019t paying attention to parliamentarian rules.\n\nIn all likelihood, this will end the same way every funding fight ends these days: Republican leadership will eventually bring up a clean bill and it will pass with mostly Democratic votes. That\u2019s long been the GOP game plan. It\u2019s also possible that Republican leadership will see this fight, with its relatively small stakes, as a good opportunity to build credibility with the Tea Party by standing up to Obama and refusing to pass a clean bill.\n\nNeither of those outcomes are good for the GOP. But this is what happens when one ideological group has outsized control over a party and wants to pick funding fights that they are certain to lose.", "topic": "Immigration", "politicalLabel": "Neutral", "organization": "New Republic", "biasLabel": "Not Biased", "title": "GOP Trapped Itself on Homeland Security Department Funding on Purpose", "yellowLabel": "Yellow", "tags": "set(['Economics', 'government shutdown', 'Home News', 'The Plank', 'immigration', 'Events', 'politics', 'Culture', 'department of homeland security', 'Books', 'Identity', 'john boehner', 'World', 'Technology', 'Politics', 'Film', 'Economy'])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
