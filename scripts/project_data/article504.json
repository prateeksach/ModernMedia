CREDIT: AP Photo/Cliff Owen, File\n\nThe official website for House Republicans has posted on YouTube a version of President Obama\u2019s State of the Union address which cuts out comments where the President was critical of Republican rhetoric on climate change, ThinkProgress has learned.\n\nIn the website\u2019s \u201cenhanced webcast\u201d of the State of the Union speech, President Obama\u2019s comments criticizing Republicans for saying they are \u201cnot scientists\u201d when it comes to climate change are erased.\n\nAt the 43:25 minute mark, President Obama is supposed to say \u201cI\u2019ve heard some folks try to dodge the evidence by saying they\u2019re not scientists; that we don\u2019t have enough information to act. Well, I\u2019m not a scientist, either. But you know what \u2014 I know a lot of really good scientists at NASA, and NOAA, and at our major universities. The best scientists in the world are all telling us that our activities are changing the climate, and if we do not act forcefully, we\u2019ll continue to see rising oceans, longer, hotter heat waves, dangerous droughts and floods, and massive disruptions that can trigger greater migration, conflict, and hunger around the globe.\u201d\n\nInstead, the entire section is skipped. Obama\u2019s comments resume with \u201cThe Pentagon says that climate change poses immediate risks to our national security. We should act like it.\u201d\n\nYou can watch the gop.gov version of the video here.\n\nThe 43:25 minute mark is not the only place where the video is incomplete. At the 44:51 minute mark, a section is missing where Obama spoke of respecting \u201chuman dignity,\u201d prohibiting torture, and speaking out against anti-Semitism. The section that is missing reads as follows: \u201cAs Americans, we respect human dignity, even when we\u2019re threatened, which is why I\u2019ve prohibited torture, and worked to make sure our use of new technology like drones is properly constrained. It\u2019s why we speak out against the deplorable anti-Semitism that has resurfaced in certain parts of the world.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for House Speaker John Boehner\u2019s office did not immediately respond to ThinkProgress\u2019 request for comment on whether the missing information was intentional or not, but we\u2019ll update if we hear back.\n\nIf it does turn out that the edits were intentional, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time a government official attempted to censor climate-related content. In 2005, media revealed that White House official Philip Cooney was altering government documents to downplay links between fossil fuels and global warming. Cooney was the chief of staff to President Bush\u2019s Council on Environmental Quality.", "topic": "Climate Change", "politicalLabel": "Liberal", "organization": "ThinkProgress", "biasLabel": "Not Biased", "title": "Republicans Post Doctored Version Of State Of The Union, Censor Facts On Climate Change", "yellowLabel": "Not Yellow", "tags": "set(['CANADA', 'CLIMATE CHANGE', 'Republicans', 'CALIFORNIA', 'Climate Change', 'State of the Union', 'RENEWABLE ENERGY', 'DROUGHT'])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
