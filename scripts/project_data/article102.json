Hong\n\nThe Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency has opened up a privately-owned, 400-bed immigrant detention center in Central California to accommodate minimum-security detainees. The facility, operated by a private prison operator with a history of mistreatment allegations, will hold immigrants transferred from local police custody in Central Valley as well as long-term detainees from other parts of the states, the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\nThe Mesa Verde Detention Facility, a private detention center operated by the for-profit prison corporation GEO Group, is located in a rural location where there aren\u2019t immigration court judges, so immigrants will have their court hearings via live video feeds, the LA Times noted.\n\nIn a press release last month, the GEO Group announced that it completed a $10 million renovation of the facility. The facility, converted from a former prison that shut down due to lack of inmates, \u201cis expected to generate approximately $17 million in annualized revenues,\u201d the release stated.\n\nAdvocates have argued that the rural location makes it difficult for detainees to meet with attorneys. They also criticized the GEO Group, which has been charged with neglect and poor conditions in the past for its operations in other immigrant detention centers.\n\nThe video feed connection to an immigration judge and the remoteness of the Bakersfield facility recall the situation at the now-defunct family detention center in Artesia, New Mexico, another GEO Group-owned facility where advocates accused officials of undertaking swift deportations to deter would-be migrants from making the trek across the southern U.S. border.\n\nLawyers at Artesia often encountered difficulties, like a female detainee who \u201csaid an official told her if she signed a paper, she\u2019d get a hearing with a judge even faster. With no land line at the facility, the detainee handbook states that women should have access to flip phones held by guards three times a day, but those interviewed said they are only allowed one 3-5 minute call each day and that if the children misbehaved, everyone lost access to phones.\u201d Other lawyers complained about the \u201cexpedited process that\u2019s taking place\u201d and that the area\u2019s isolation makes it \u201cimpossible for the pro bono community to step forward.\u201d\n\nWhen probed by the LA Times about the remote location of the Bakersfield detention center, ICE officials said that it \u201caffords us the option to house foreign nationals encountered in Central California at a facility closer to their families and communities.\u201d\n\nICE told The Bakersfield Californian last month that \u201cthe detainees, all men, will live in a dorm-style environment with communal day rooms where they can watch television, make phone calls and play board games. \u2026 They will have access to an on-site law library, a medical clinic and religious services.\u201d The facility will also include dining and visitation rooms and recreation areas, while their health care will be provided by GEO\u2019s Care Division.\n\nLast year, hundreds of detainees went on a hunger strike at the GEO Group-owned, 1,575-bed Northwest Detention Center, complaining about the \u201cbad food, substandard medical care, high commissary prices and lack of access to fair and timely court hearings,\u201d the Seattle Globalist wrote. In 2012, Fernando Dominguez Valdivia, an immigrant detainee at the GEO-owned Adelanto Immigration Center, died from bronchopneumonia without receiving adequate medical attention. Valdivia\u2019s death was deemed preventable according to a U.S. Office of Detention Oversight investigation afterwards.\n\nPrivate prison operators have an incentive to keep as many detainees in its centers. Each detainee is worth about $107 a night to the GEO Group at the Mesa Verde Detention Facility, the LA Times noted. That incentive likely helps maintain the federal government\u2019s bed quota mandate, a federal requirement for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to detain at least 34,000 people per day in detention facilities. A quick glance at just one recent federal solicitation for a 2,000-bed immigrant detention facility requests that \u201cthe contractor will be required to house a daily population of 100 [percent] of the accepted contract beds.\u201d\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson announced the dissolution of the federal enforcement program known as Secure Communities last November, a controversial program that led to numerous jurisdictions limiting their cooperation with ICE to transfer over suspected undocumented immigrants. ICE Director Sarah Salda\u00f1a recently had to walk back a statement during a House hearing saying that she supports a policy to require local law enforcement officers to hold immigrants for ICE.", "topic": "Immigration", "politicalLabel": "Liberal", "organization": "ThinkProgress", "biasLabel": "Biased", "title": "Private Prison Operator Set To Rake In $17 Million With New 400-Bed Detention Center", "yellowLabel": "Not Yellow", "tags": "set(['DEPORTATION', 'Deportation', 'MEXICO', 'Immigration', 'IMMIGRATION', 'MARCO RUBIO', 'California', 'Immigration and Customs Enforcement', 'CALIFORNIA'])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
