(Photo: Norm Shafer/The Washington Post)\n\nFacing possible schism between those who support and oppose gay marriage, United Methodists are attempting to settle differences through intimate meditation processes called \u201cjust resolutions.\u201d But more than a year of these deals from Michigan to Alabama shows how elusive is true reconciliation.\n\nBishops and other clergy began looking for another alternative after the hugely controversial spectacle in 2013 of a church trial for a Pennsylvania pastor who officiated at his son\u2019s marriage to another man. Since then at least nine other Methodist clergy --including two in Virginia \u2014 who performed the banned weddings have gone through a mediation process with their accusers.\n\nYet it\u2019s unclear whether the resulting agreements known as \u201cjust resolutions\u201d \u2014 aimed, according to the United Methodist Church, at realizing \u201cGod\u2019s work of justice, reconciliation and healing\u201d \u2014 have done much to bridge moral disagreements between those who support gay marriage and those who don\u2019t. While some see them as a sign of progress, others find them alienating.\n\nThe Rev. Frank Schaefer, who was found guilty at his 2013 trial but reinstated last year after an appeal, said he is \u201cfurious\u201d that clergy are being punished through the just resolution processes but knows conservatives are unsatisfied as well. Their main value, he said, is avoiding painful, costly trials.\n\n\u201cThese are just Band-Aid solutions for the moment for this time and place,\u201d Schaefer said .\u201dWe\u2019re all groping, you know\u2026we have to find Band-Aid solutions to keep this United Methodist Church united and from falling apart.\u201d\n\nThe actual agreements, which are negotiated individually by parties involved, vary widely.\n\nThe Rev. John Copenhaver of Winchester was suspended for three months, though he is retired. The Rev. Amanda Garber was suspended for a month without pay from her start-up church in Harrisonburg.\n\nWhile Bishop Young Jin Cho praised the parties for their \u201cpatience, honesty, and open mindedness,\u201d both pastors refused to call it a \u201cjust resolution,\u201d saying it didn\u2019t bring healing. Critics of gay marriage say the pastors weren\u2019t penalized enough.\n\nIn Michigan, a just resolution deal required two pastors to create a \u201ctruth and reconciliation commission\u201d modeled after those in South Africa and Greensboro, North Carolina, that sought racial healing. An Iowa pastor was required to write a paper that fairly describes \u201cthe hurt that was inflicted\u201d by his performing the wedding \u2014 a paper that would also include the harm he sees the church doing to gay and lesbian people by its wedding ban.\n\nWhether opponents and proponents of gay marriage can co-exist is a pressing issue for institutional religions in general. But the United Methodist Church \u2014 the country\u2019s second-largest Protestant denomination \u2014 is approaching its once-every-four-years convention next year and the possibility of a schism over the matter. Votes are expected on whether to change the Book of Discipline, which says \u201cthe practice of homosexuality is incompatible with Christian teaching.\u201d Multiple compromise ideas are being floated.\n\nSome refer to the just resolutions, to which both parties must agree, as primarily a stop-gap before the 2016 General Conference, when the two sides will remove the gloves.\n\nIn the meantime, true compromise appears elusive.\n\nThe Rev. Ed Rowe, who recently retired from a Detroit congregation, signed a just resolution in November that \u201cacknowledges\u201d he violated the Book of Discipline and that \u201cothers may have felt hurt\u201d by his officiating the wedding of two of his gay congregants. It calls for him to set up a truth and reconciliation commission that has the stated goal of \u201creducing our church\u2019s harmful rhetoric and actions towards LGBTQ persons.\u201d\n\nThe beliefs of church members who are against gay marriage are less important than the harm to gays and lesbians who endure discrimination, he said.\n\n\u201cThere has to be a hierarchy of harm. People who felt harmed that the piece of the covenant they want to keep was violated, that compares to some 17-year-old kid in the pew who is listening to their pastor talking about how they are going to hell? I\u2019m interested in what\u2019s endangering the lives of our people.\u201d\n\nA central issue is that the Book of Discipline to many appears contradictory. It explicitly bans clergy who are in gay relationships and same-gender weddings, but also calls the church to \u201cdedicate itself to a ministry of Christ-like hospitality and compassion to persons of all sexual orientations.\u201d\n\nThis has resulted in agreements that are vague about what it means to honor the doctrine.\n\nRev. Michael Tupper in Michigan, who officiated at his daughter\u2019s wedding, agreed to \u201cwork with his clergy colleagues by using the proper channels toward changing the discriminatory language and provisions in our Book of Discipline.\u201d An agreement in the case of retired Bishop Melvin Talbert, who performed a wedding in 2013 in Alabama, simply says that \u201cAll parties in this just resolution process agree to live according to the Book of Discipline.\u201d\n\nGerman Bishop Rosemarie Wenner was president of the denomination\u2019s bishop body at the time of the Talbert case, and was asked by that council to submit a complaint against him. She said the agreement she and Birmingham, Alabama-area Bishop Debra Wallace-Padgett signed with Talbert doesn\u2019t mean everyone agreed.\n\n\u201cWe will not come to one understanding of how to interpret the Bible and look at homosexuality. So we will have to learn to live with differences,\u201d she said. \u201cI see signs of willingness to learn this out of a spirit of grace and respect for one another.\u201d\n\nThe United Methodist Church is becoming even more diverse. Founded in 1968 in Dallas, its roots go to the 1700s. However, like much of Christianity, its growth today is in the developing world \u2014 particularly in Africa and the Philippines, where United Methodists tend to vote against gay equality.\n\nAt the General Conference next year, 58 percent of delegates will be from the United states, 30 percent from Africa, 4.6 percent from Europe and nearly 6 percent from the Philippines.\n\nIn all cases the complaintants are the pastors\u2019 supervisors \u2014 called superintendents \u2014 and their bishops, not ordinary United Methodists. The bulk of the details of the just resolutions are kept private so it\u2019s hard to gauge whether the supervisors describe deeply disagreeing with gay marriage or rather are trying to simply uphold the rule book. Many declined to comment for this story.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how fully either side is heard during the process.\n\nThe just resolutions are \u201cmaking people feel further apart from one another,\u201d said John Lomperis, a United Methodist who advocates with the orthodox Protestant group Institute On Religion and Democracy. \u201cIf someone says: \u2018You can\u2019t trust me to keep my own word when I vowed to uphold these standards,\u2019 I don\u2019t see what having someone like that adds to our ministry,\u201d Lomperis said.\n\nLomperis said that the handful of cases are being overblown. There are tens of thousands of UMC pastors, he said, and only a few are openly violating church rules.\n\nGarber, the Harrisonburg pastor, agreed to marry two of her congregants last year after turning down another couple in 2012. Watching another pastor who didn\u2019t know the couple perform that earlier wedding, \u201cI felt like an enormous coward. I felt like a poor excuse for a pastor,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile Bishop Cho calls their deal a \u201cjust resolution,\u201d Garber calls it a \u201ccomplaint resolution.\u201d\n\nThe deal says Garber \u201ccould not obey\u201d discrimination and that both parties acknowledge there is a split in the church on sexuality. It says her superintendent, the Rev. Tommy Herndon, filed the complaint \u201cbecause of his conviction that it is necessary to maintain both order and unity within the church.\u201d\n\nHerndon did not respond to a request for comment and Cho\u2019s office referred the Post to his statement.\n\n\u201cWe struggled a lot with language \u2014 a lot. We struggled to hear each other,\u201d she said of the just resolution process. \u201cI just wanted to see us work towards something that offered hope and healing and I was disappointed it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nbc-marriage-methodists (TPN)\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.newsleader.com/story/news/local/2015/03/17/possible-methodists-agree-disagree-gay-marriage/24923283/", "topic": "Gay Marriage", "politicalLabel": "Neutral", "organization": "USA Today", "biasLabel": "Not Biased", "title": "Is it possible for Methodists to agree to disagree on gay marriage?", "yellowLabel": "Not Yellow", "tags": "set(['Interactives', 'Investigations'])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
