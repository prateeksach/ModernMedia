Solis\n\nA Mississippi law that would eliminate access to abortion within that state \u2014 a law so restrictive that it was halted by one of the most conservative federal appeals courts in the nation \u2014 arrived in the Supreme Court on Wednesday after the state filed a petition asking the justices to hear the case. Should the Court agree to do so, Mississippi could win the right to close down its only abortion clinic.\n\nMississippi\u2019s law closely resembles laws in other states imposing restrictions on which doctors may perform abortions. The law requires all physicians associated with an \u201cabortion facility\u201d to \u201chave admitting privileges at a local hospital and staff privileges to replace local hospital on-staff physicians.\u201d This restriction significantly diminishes the pool of doctors will work in an abortion clinic, because local doctors are often unable or unwilling to perform abortions while they maintain an active practice in a conservative community.\n\nAs Judge Myron Thompson explained in a decision striking down a similar Alabama law, many hospitals will only grant admitting privileges to physicians who live locally, but local doctors often legitimately fear that they will suffer professional consequences \u2014 or worse \u2014 if their local community learns that they perform abortions. Thompson also described the risk that local physicians will become victims of terrorism if they perform abortions. As one abortion doctor, whose home is under FBI surveillance, testified, \u201cevery time I go to work . . . I\u2019m always afraid that there will be somebody who is in the crowd who is passionate enough about the topic that they\u2019re willing to shoot.\u201d\n\nFor these and related reasons, abortion clinics in conservative states often rely upon out-of-state physicians or largely retired doctors whose practice is no longer large enough for them to receive admitting privileges from a hospital. If these doctors are forbidden from performing abortions, many clinics will simply need to shut down. Indeed, that\u2019s exactly what happened to nearly half of the 40 abortion clinics that once operated in Texas after the conservative United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit allowed that state\u2019s admitting privileges law to take effect.\n\nNevertheless, a divided panel of three Fifth Circuit judges halted Mississippi\u2019s law due to a crucial distinction between that state and Texas. Mississippi doesn\u2019t have 40 abortion clinics, it has one abortion clinic. And if this law goes into effect, that clinic will no longer be able to operate.\n\nIn the Fifth Circuit, Mississippi claimed that shutting down the state\u2019s sole abortion clinic would not violate women\u2019s constitutional rights because those women could still seek abortions in the neighboring states of Tennessee, Louisiana or Alabama. Not so, according to the court. As Judge E. Grady Jolly, a Reagan appointee, explained, \u201cMississippi may not shift its obligation to respect the established constitutional rights of its citizens to another state. Such a proposal would not only place an undue burden on the exercise of the constitutional right, but would also disregard a state\u2019s obligation under the principle of federalism\u2014applicable to all fifty states\u2014to accept the burden of the non-delegable duty of protecting the established federal constitutional rights of its own citizens.\u201d\n\nAdmitting privileges laws such as the one in Mississippi are part of a larger effort to restrict or even eliminate the practice by enacting laws that, at least on their face, appear to be health regulations. And, indeed, Mississippi\u2019s petition to the Supreme Court opens by painting its law as an effort to ensure that abortions are performed safely. \u201cConcerned by highly publicized reports of deaths and injuries involving abortion facilities across the country that raised serious doubts as to the safety of women undergoing abortion procedures,\u201d the petition claims, \u201cthe legislatures in numerous states, including Mississippi, increasingly began requiring doctors performing abortions to hold admitting privileges at local hospitals.\u201d\n\nYet, as Judge Thompson explained in his opinion striking down Alabama\u2019s law, admitting privileges requirements do little, if anything, to protect women\u2019s health. \u201cComplications that require hospitalization occur in only 0.05 to 0.3% of\u201d early term abortions, Thompson explained. Another judge, Judge Lee Yeakel, was more blunt \u2014 \u201cthere is no rational relationship between improved patient outcomes and hospital admitting privileges.\u201d\n\nAdmitting privileges laws are one of the most common forms of sham health laws that seek to take advantage of a loophole in the Supreme Court\u2019s abortion jurisprudence in order to limit access to abortion. State governments may enact legitimate health regulations that government abortion clinics \u2014 and, indeed, they should have this power. This is why a state may require abortions to be performed by licensed physicians, for example. Or why a state could subject clinics to routine inspections to ensure that their facilities meet standards recognized by the medical profession.\n\nBut that does not mean that states can dress up a law intended to limit the right to choose as a health regulation and expect it to survive contact with what remains of Roe v. Wade. If the justices ultimately allow such sham health laws to stand, a state\u2019s ability to limit access to abortion could be limited only by their creativity in designing anti-abortion laws that bear some superficial resemblance to health laws.", "topic": "Abortion", "politicalLabel": "Neutral", "organization": "ThinkProgress", "biasLabel": "Biased", "title": "The Nation's Most Restrictive Anti-Abortion Law Just Reached The Supreme Court", "yellowLabel": "Not Yellow", "tags": "set(['Mississippi', 'NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION', 'Abortion', 'IMMIGRATION', 'POLICE BRUTALITY', 'Supreme Court', 'CRIMINAL JUSTICE', 'CALIFORNIA'])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
