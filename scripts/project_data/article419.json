{"content": "happy cinco de mayo xx A photo posted by Beatrix Kiddo (@irelandbbaldwin) on May 5, 2014 at 8:05pm PDT\n\nThat\u2019s one way to grab her dad\u2019s attention.\n\nStanding 6 feet, 2 inches tall with blue eyes and golden hair, Ireland Baldwin, daughter of rageaholic actor Alec Baldwin, is a ravishing model of 18. She\u2019s been toying lately with the supposed prejudices of her allegedly homophobic and racist father \u2014 reputations that have stuck to The Bloviator, 56, like toilet paper to a shoe bottom, despite his denials that he has problems dealing with homosexuals and African-Americans.\n\nIreland has lately exchanged suggestive posts on social media with her female pal Angel Haze. A Detroit-born rapper of color, Angel, 22, has called herself \u201cpansexual.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cLove is boundary-less,\u2019\u2019 she explained to The Guardian newspaper in 2012. \u201cIf you can make me feel, if you can make me laugh \u2014 and that\u2019s hard \u2014 then I can be with you. I don\u2019t care if you have a vagina or if you\u2019re a hermaphrodite or whatever.\u201d\n\nIn April, a month after Ireland split from boyfriend Slater Trout, the messages started flying between the young women on Instagram and Twitter.\n\nAngel \u2014 real name Raykeea Angel Wilson \u2014 tweeted to Ireland April 5, \u201cYour body is a canvas. I want to paint it red.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are so many things. You have so many meanings,\u2019\u2019 Ireland replied April 15.\n\nThe \u201cBattlecry\u2019\u2019 rapper retweeted a May 1 pic focused on Ireland\u2019s cleavage and captioned it, \u201cI just wanna say you\u2019re mine you\u2019re mineeeee.\u2019\u2019\n\nOn May 5, Ireland wished Angel a \u201cHappy cinco de mayo xx\u201d on Instagram, posting a photo of the pair seated on the ground, kissing.\n\nIreland took things to the next level May 21, tweeting, \u201cDon\u2019t let this go to your head, but you\u2019re the best I\u2019ve ever had.\u2019\u2019\n\nI haven\u2019t a clue if Ireland and Angel are just friends, in love or messing with Alec\u2019s head. None of my business. But on June 4, the gals were spotted by paparazzi after eating brunch with friends in Sherman Oaks, Calif.\n\nWith cameras clicking and, I imagine, hearts pounding, they faced each other on the sidewalk. And they shared a steamy kiss.\n\nToday, families everywhere are coming to terms with the sexual orientations of loved ones. Dick Cheney and his wife, Lynne, have embraced the fact that their daughter Mary, a mother of two, is a lesbian married to a woman. Any reservations I had about homosexuality dissolved three years ago when my niece, whom I adore, married a lovely lady in Massachusetts.\n\nA majority of Americans \u2014 56 percent \u2014 support same-sex marriage, and it\u2019s legal in 19 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nBut Alec, the politically liberal star of \u201c30 Rock,\u2019\u2019 can\u2019t seem to get his head into the 21st century.\n\nAlec called a British journalist a \u201ctoxic little queen\u2019\u2019 on Twitter for writing, wrongly, that his wife, Hilaria, now 30, tweeted during James Gandolfini\u2019s funeral. Alec also wrote that he\u2019d stick his foot up the reporter\u2019s backside \u201cbut I\u2019m sure you\u2019d dig it too much.\u2019\u2019\n\nIn November, he was heard screaming at a photographer, \u00ad\u201cc\u2014sucking f-g!\u201d after the shooter got too close to his wife and baby daughter, Carmen. Alec insisted that he only called the shutterbug a \u201cc\u2014sucking fathead.\u201d\n\nHe apologized to friends and colleagues in a letter posted on the website of MSNBC and vowed to retire the vulgar word from his vocabulary. But MSNBC canceled Alec\u2019s talk show, \u201cUp Late with Alec Baldwin.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe also denied calling black Post photographer G.N. Miller \u2014 a retired NYPD narcotics detective \u2014 a \u201ccoon\u201d and a \u201cdrug dealer\u201d last year. Alec tweeted that the lensman was an \u201cex-crackhead.\u201d\n\nAlec and Ireland have made peace since 2007, when the actor ranted into his then-11-year-old daughter\u2019s answering machine, calling her \u201ca rude, thoughtless little pig\u2019\u2019 for failing to answer his phone calls. His excuse? He said he was stressed out by a child-custody battle with Ireland\u2019s mom and Alec\u2019s first wife, the actress Kim Basinger, who he said alienated the child from him. He hasn\u2019t said a word publicly about her relationship with Angel Haze.\n\nAlec and I have something in common. Each of us is the parent of a teenage daughter. Hey, Alec \u2014 give me a call if you need advice.\n\nYou know where to find me.\n\nFlipper snapper\n\nHow twisted! Margaret Howe Lovatt was an assistant in a 1965 experiment based in the US Virgin Islands, partly funded by NASA, in which the late neuroscientist John Lilly tried to teach Peter, a bottlenose dolphin, and others to speak English. The assistant, then 23, lived with Peter 24/7. She did a lot more than encourage a sea mammal to communicate, according to a TV documentary by Britain\u2019s BBC network set to air this week, \u201cThe Girl Who Talked to Dolphins.\u2019\u2019\n\nPeter, who was 6, never spoke. But he fell in love. Or lust. Or something. So his pervy human companion regularly pleasured the creature manually, Lovatt admitted.\n\nRumors abounded that dolphins were given the mind-altering drug LSD and the experiment ran out of funding. Peter was sent to live in a lab in a Miami and within a few weeks, he committed suicide by refusing to breathe. A veterinarian said he died of a broken heart.\n\nHow does this woman live with herself?\n\nHarlem rent lotto is a cheap trick\n\nA new housing development in Harlem closed out its lottery with 50,000 applicants for 99 permanently affordable flats. (Another 25 are for the homeless.) Rents at the Sugar Hill Complex in Manhattan are an incredibly low $349 for a studio and top out at $1,588 for a three-bedroom. But a lottery winner\u2019s chances of grabbing cheapo rooms is less than 500-to-1 in a development built with public money and private donations.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s time to consider moving to Queens.\n\nThe \u2018Killer\u2019 kids of camp hamas\n\nThousands of Palestinian kids ages 5 to 16 are learning to be terrorists at a Hamas-run camp in the southern Gaza Strip, disturbing photographs taken by Abed Rahim Khatib reveal.\n\nInstead of singing around campfires, the children participate in dangerous military exercises, including running through obstacle courses amid open flames. They wear war paint on their faces, scream chants and learn how to carry AK-47 assault rifles.\n\nGaza has been controlled by the Hamas terror group since 2007. Be afraid. Hamas leaders have no problem recruiting anti-Israel child soldiers.\n\nMaking big bucks is child\u2019s play for NY baby sitters\n\nGuilt-ridden New York City parents are paying up. The city\u2019s baby sitters are the country\u2019s highest-paid caregivers, each commanding average wages of $15.34 an hour to look after a single child, according to UrbanSitter.com. Top hourly pay is $33, The Post\u2019s Dana Schuster reported. Chicago\u2019s sitters get $11 an hour on average, and Denver\u2019s $10.84.\n\nOther perks bestowed on New York\u2019s sitters include sushi dinners from Nobu and the use of car services.\n\nThink of kids as luxury items.", "topic": "Gay Marriage", "politicalLabel": "Liberal", "organization": "New York Post", "biasLabel": "Biased", "title": "Alec Baldwin must be shocked by daughter Ireland\u2019s same-sex pal", "yellowLabel": "Yellow", "tags": "set(['Angel Haze', 'Alec Baldwin', 'Ireland Baldwin'])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
