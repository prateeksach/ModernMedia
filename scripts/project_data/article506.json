You\u2019ve got one side that is denying the facts, who are often motivated, principally, by opposing whatever it is that I propose,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThat\u2019s not inevitable to our democracy. That\u2019s a phase that the Republican party is going through right now. And it\u2019ll outgrow that phase.\u201d\n\nLast month, Sen. James Inhofe (R-OK), chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works committee, brought a snowball onto the floor of the Senate, noting that the presence of snow in February proves global warming is a hoax. In the interview, Obama called the stunt \u201cdisturbing.\u201d\n\nObama attributed some public reluctance to economic concerns, noting that he couldn\u2019t fault someone who was worried about paying their bills or buying gas in order to drive themselves to work. But some resistance in Congress, Obama noted, is due to the strong influence that oil and gas industries hold over certain elected officials.\n\n\u201cIn some cases \u2026 you have elected officials who are shills for the oil companies or the fossil fuel industry, and there\u2019s a lot of money involved,\u201d Obama said. \u201cTypically in Congress, the committees of jurisdiction, like the energy committees, are populated by folks from places that pump a lot of oil and pump a lot of gas.\u201d\n\nHe expressed hope, however, that a younger, more environmentally-conscious generation of voters would be able to exert influence over Congress, forcing the Republican party to change its tune on climate change.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s what keeps me optimistic. You talk to Malia and Sasha, [who are] 13 and 16, and the sophistication and awareness that they have about environmental issues \u2026 they\u2019re way ahead of the game,\u201d Obama said. \u201cI guarantee you that the Republican party will have to change its approach to climate change, because voters will insist upon it.\u201d A recent Stanford University poll found that two-thirds of voters were more likely to vote for a candidate that campaigned on a platform of fighting climate change, and were less likely to vote for a candidate that outright denies climate change.\n\nStill, Obama noted that he has a ways to go in completing his personal climate agenda, listing goals like doubling the domestic production of clean energy, and gaining commitments from China on a plant to curb its greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m able to do all those things now, when I\u2019m done, we\u2019re still going to have a heck of a problem,\u201d Obama said, \u201cbut we will have made enough progress that the next president and the next generations can start building on it, and you start getting some momentum.\u201d", "topic": "Climate Change", "politicalLabel": "Liberal", "organization": "ThinkProgress", "biasLabel": "Not Biased", "title": "Obama: Republicans Are 'Motivated, Principally, By Opposing Whatever It Is That I Propose'", "yellowLabel": "Not Yellow", "tags": "set(['CANADA', 'Climate Change', 'CLIMATE CHANGE', 'Barack Obama', 'RENEWABLE ENERGY', 'CALIFORNIA', 'DROUGHT'])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
