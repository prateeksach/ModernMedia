{"content": "Can a TV series show a regular character getting an abortion \u2014 matter of factly, no drama, no hesitation?\n\n\u201cParenthood,\u201d about an extended, untraditional family trying to cope with kids and each other, did it last week. And if the idea was to escape controversy, it seems to have worked.\n\nThe network fully backed last week\u2019s controversial episode in which high schooler Amy (Skyler Day) terminated her pregnancy, executive producer Jason Katims says.\n\nNBC said it was \u201cgoing to support us to tell this story because they felt we would tell it in a way that was not politicized,\u201d he tells The Post.\n\n\u201cThey wanted to make sure that we were responsible in terms of the facts and how we told the story. But they did not ever suggest that we don\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nIn the emotional episode \u2014 which drew fire from several Riight to Life groups but not an outpouring of protest \u2014 Amy decides to go through with the procedure, despite objections from her boyfriend, Drew (Miles Heizer).\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only one option,\u201d she tells him. \u201cIf I have this baby, my life is over.\u201d\n\nKatims says the show\u2019s writers and producers \u201cdiscussed every possibility\u201d but never seriously considered having the teen keep her baby.\n\nTV\u2019s most famous abortion was more than 40 years ago, when Maude (played by Bea Arthur) decided to terminate her unexpected pregnancy because she was in her late 40s.\n\nThe episode generated millions of letters in protest and discouraged networks from taking on abortion again for years to come.\n\n\u201cThis episode, obviously endorsed by Planned Parenthood itself, was more like a giant advertisement for the abortion provider than it was an entertainment show,\u201d the human rights group Live Action wrote in a blog post.\n\nBut NBC appears to be standing by its show \u2014 if for no other reason than that people are starting to talk about it with great passion.\n\nUntil recently, \u201cParenthood\u201d\u2014 which draws about 5 million viewers each week \u2014 had been unsure at the end of each season if it was going to return.\n\nBut buzz about the show began to build late last year, when one of the show\u2019s main characters, played by Monica Potter, revealed she was fighting breast cancer.\n\n\u201cIt kind of raised the stakes, in a way,\u201d Katims says. \u201cThe show itself has continued to creatively grow and deepen.\n\n\u201cI feel like what we are trying to do overall is find a balance between the more difficult stories and the ones that are lighter.\n\n\u201cThat, I think, is the charm of the show.\u201d\n\nRatings also got a boost from the addition of recurring guest star Ray Romano, who appeared for several episodes as the love interest of Sarah Braverman (Lauren Graham).", "topic": "Abortion", "politicalLabel": "Neutral", "organization": "New York Post", "biasLabel": "Biased", "title": "\u2018Parenthood\u2019 did what few have tried \u2014 make abortion seem nearly normal", "yellowLabel": "Not Yellow", "tags": "set(['Game of Thrones', 'Hillary Clinton', 'the masters', 'Chess', 'New York Yankees', 'NYPD'])", "opinionLabel": "Opinion Article"}
