{"content": "Story highlights Voters in Maine and Maryland approve same-sex marriage\n\nIt's the first time voters have approved same-sex marriage\n\nIn the past, only judges or legislatures had approved it\n\nThe votes show a dramatic shift in attitudes over the decades\n\nIn a historic turnaround, the ballot box is showing America's shifting attitudes about same-sex marriage. After gay marriage rights died at the polls dozens of times in the past, on Tuesday they passed in at least two states.\n\nRarely do popular votes reflect such dramatic social changes.\n\nThe result: Maryland and Maine will now allow couples like Chyrino Patane and James Trinidad to tie the knot.\n\nThe Maryland couple has been together for seven years, and now, after the historic vote, they plan to marry in the next six months to a year.\n\n\"Both families will be at the wedding,\" Patane said.\n\nBut the win was hard fought and the margin of victory was small.\n\nJust Watched Popular vote on same-sex marriage replay More Videos ...

The pair led their guests to the summit of a cliff for the ceremony in lieu of a traditional wedding march -- using the spot to represent their union: \"a place so old and solid with such a promising view of the horizon beyond.\" Hide Caption 1 of 11 Same-sex wedding snapshots 11 photos Same-sex wedding snapshots \u2013 Alex and Tony wanted to keep their wedding simple and inexpensive: They made picnic lunches for guests and painted wooden dolls in their likeness for cake toppers.

They were inspired to get married after \"don't ask, don't tell\" was repealed, but it took an extra nudge from her teenage daughter to set the wheels in motion. Valezka's daughter and her aunt were bridesmaids; they wore red and blue to match the sailor theme.

And in Minnesota, voters rejected a measure that would have banned same-sex marriage.\n\nPollsters got a hint of the coming change. Recent national surveys have shown shifting attitudes toward same-sex marriage, with a majority of Americans now approving of marriages between two men or two women. A June CNN/ORC poll, for example, reflected such a shift in opinion in the U.S.\n\nSupport has been growing for decades.\n\nIn the 1990s, most Americans told pollsters they did not know anyone close to them who was gay. By 2010, the number of Americans who said they had a gay or lesbian close friend or family member was 49%. This year, that number stands at 60%.\n\nMaryland, Maine approve same-sex marriage\n\nElection Day brought two additional gains for proponents of same-sex marriage: Wisconsin elected America's first openly lesbian senator, Democrat Tammy Baldwin, and President Obama became the first president to openly support same-sex marriage and get re-elected.\n\nWisconsin's Baldwin is first openly gay person elected to Senate\n\n\"I have never been this happy after an election in my 17 years of voting,\" said Derek Hurder from Hampden, Maine, who's been with his partner, Chris McLaughlin, for a year and a half.\n\nThey're not yet ready for marriage, but they were elated about having the option. And they both voted to re-elect the president.\n\nThe change in attitude makes them feel more comfortable, but that has its limits. \"I wouldn't feel safe walking down the street holding hands,\" Hurder said.\n\nPatane and Trinidad share their Catholic faith and are despondent that the church won't recognize their union.\n\n\"I believe in a religious marriage,\" Trinidad said. \"I recognize that it's going to be a nonreligious wedding.\"\n\nTobey and Ouellette, who met four years ago, tied the knot last September -- in a church.\n\n\"We are affiliated with the United Methodist Church, which on the whole does not support same-sex marriage,\" Tobey said. But their church made a hearty exception. \"We had three pastors who know us and love us and agreed to do that for us.\"\n\nThe legal situation led the couple to do things in reverse order. After their wedding, they applied for a name change. Now that the referendum has passed, they'll apply for a marriage license.\n\nMaine should begin granting marriage licenses to same-sex couples in mid-December, according to same-sex marriage supporters at Freedom to Marry.\n\nWhat the measures say\n\nThe two measures that passed, called \"Question 1\" in Maine and \"Question 6\" in Maryland, contain similar language.\n\nThe words man and woman \"relating to the marital relationship or familial relationships must be construed to be gender-neutral for all purposes,\" the Maine measure says.\n\nMaryland's ballot reads, \"Civil marriage laws allow gay and lesbian couples to obtain a civil marriage license.\"\n\nBoth measures also explicitly mention the right of clergy to refuse to wed gay and lesbian couples if it goes against their religious convictions.\n\n\"This chapter does not require any member of the clergy to perform or any church, religious denomination or other religious institution to host any marriage in violation of the religious beliefs of that member of the clergy, church, religious denomination or other religious institution,\" Maine's Question 1 states.\n\nThe governments of Maine and Maryland had passed laws permitting same-sex marriage, but activists opposed to the laws collected enough signatures to put them on a ballot, said Fred Sainz, a spokesman for Human Rights Campaign, which raised $32 million for its campaigns on the referendums that included radio and television ads, social media strategy and on-the-ground canvassing by thousands of volunteers.\n\nOpponents of same-sex marriage say the new laws in both states will redefine marriage for everyone as a genderless union and endanger the fabric of society.\n\n\"Such a radical change in the definition of marriage will produce a host of societal conflicts that government -- exercising its enormous enforcement powers -- will have to resolve,\" argues Maryland Marriage Alliance.\n\nThe group also published an online opinion by parents stating that legalizing same-sex marriage would lead to the promotion of homosexuality in school curriculum.\n\nElection results raise questions about Christian right's influence\n\nSainz believes the campaigns supporting the Maine measure paid off.\n\nIn 2009, a similar referendum in Maine failed when voters rejected the governor's decision to allow same-sex marriage. Tuesday's results represent a remarkable turnaround.\n\n\"The secret to our success is that we won over hearts and minds,\" Sainz said. \"Americans are fair and want to see their gay and lesbian friends, co-workers and family members have the freedom to marry.\"\n\nThirty-eight states have passed bans on marriages between people of the same gender, mostly by amending their constitutions to define marriage as a union between a man and a woman.\n\nIn the six states -- Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, Vermont, New Hampshire and New York -- and the District of Columbia where gays and lesbians have previously won marriage rights, it was because of actions taken by judges or legislators, not voters.\n\nOn election night, Tobey joined friends as they all watched results on TV.\n\nShe wasn't expecting Maine's ballot to pass. But then they heard the news.\n\n\"I said: 'Hey, did that just happen?' \"\n\nShe did a double take.", "topic": "Gay Marriage", "politicalLabel": "Liberal", "organization": "CNN", "biasLabel": "Not Biased", "title": "Voters approve same-sex marriage for the first time", "yellowLabel": "Not Yellow", "tags": "set([])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
