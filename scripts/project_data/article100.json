Scott Walker (R) supported the idea of providing a pathway to citizenship for some undocumented immigrants in the country, the Wall Street Journal first reported Thursday. The remarks, confirmed by three dinner attendees, comes at a time when Walker has swung wildly on a concrete position to address the undocumented immigrant population.\n\nUndocumented immigrants shouldn\u2019t be deported and they should be allowed to \u201c\u2018eventually get their citizenship without being given preferential treatment\u2019 ahead of people already in line to obtain citizenship,\u201d Walker said at the dinner, according to the WSJ. One dinner attendee said, \u201cHe said no to citizenship now, but later they could get it.\u201d Another attendee reported that Walker said that undocumented immigrants should \u201cget to the back of the line for citizenship\u201d but not be deported.\n\nIf these accounts are accurate, Walker\u2019s position literally changed overnight when he publicly told reporters the following day that he \u201clistened to people nationwide, especially border governors\u201d and decided to oppose a path to citizenship.\n\nEarly this month, Walker told Fox News Sunday\u2019s Chris Wallace that he didn\u2019t support \u201camnesty.\u201d To that end, his state signed onto a lawsuit against the president\u2019s executive action to grant temporary legal presence to some undocumented immigrants. In the interview, Walker was emphatic about the need for border security and a way to ensure a legal immigration system. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to governors on the border and others out there,\u201d Walker said. \u201cThe concerns I have are that we need to secure the border. We ultimately need to put in a system that works \u2014 a legal immigration system that works. And part of doing that is putting the onus on employers, getting them E-Verify and tools to do that, but I don\u2019t think you do it through amnesty.\u201d\n\nWalker\u2019s public position on immigrants is a far departure from the views he\u2019s held over the past 13 years. Walker, a county executive in Milwaukee County between 2002 and 2006, twice signed resolutions backing programs that would have granted legal status to undocumented immigrants.\n\nDuring a sit-down conversation with the Wausau Daily Herald editorial board in 2013, Walker said, \u201cyou hear some people talk about border security and a wall and all that. To me, I don\u2019t know that you need any of that if you had a better, saner way to let people into the country in the first place.\u201d\n\nWhen asked by the Daily Herald whether one can \u201cenvision a world where, with the right penalties and waiting periods and meet the requirements, where those people could get citizenship,\u201d Walker answered, \u201cSure. Yeah. I mean, I think it makes sense.\u201d\n\nAddressing the 11 million undocumented population has been something of a tightrope walk for Republican presidential hopefuls who are striking the balance between appealing to Latino voters, a constituency they claim to court, and pandering to the wide-ranging chorus of moderate voters and Tea Party supporters.\n\nFormer Gov. Jeb Bush (R-FL), a moderate presidential frontrunner, has gone through varying degrees of this routine. Some highlights of his evolution between 1994 and present day have seen him swing from a deportation-only policy, to calling undocumented immigration \u201can act of love.\u201d And Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), another potential candidate, has repeatedly changed his stance on immigration, first fighting to pass comprehensive immigration reform as a core member of the Senate\u2019s Gang of Eight, then cycling through stages of regret before ultimately abandoning his immigration reform rhetoric.", "topic": "Immigration", "politicalLabel": "Liberal", "organization": "ThinkProgress", "biasLabel": "Biased", "title": "At Private Dinner, Sources Say Scott Walker Has A Totally Different Take On Immigration", "yellowLabel": "Not Yellow", "tags": "set(['DEPORTATION', 'Deportation', 'Wisconsin', 'MEXICO', 'IMMIGRATION', 'Immigration', 'MARCO RUBIO', 'CALIFORNIA', 'Scott Walker'])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
