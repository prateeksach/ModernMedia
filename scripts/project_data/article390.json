{"content": "For the first time, Congress will have 100 women in office, thanks to Tuesday\u2019s midterm elections. And of the three state-based initiatives that would have restricted women\u2019s access to abortion, two\u2014the \u201cpersonhood\u201d measures in Colorado and North Dakota defining life at fertilization\u2014failed. Only Tennesse\u2019s proposal, a constitutional amendment giving lawmakers more leeway to restrict abortion, passed.\n\nBut this election wasn\u2019t a victory for women\u2019s rights, because Republicans\u2014the party that opposes abortion rights and opposes many forms of birth control\u2014gained a lot of power last night. Not only did they take control of the Senate. They also took over a record number of state legislatures. And that\u2019s where they\u2019ve managed to do some of their greatest damage lately.\n\nBefore Tuesday, Republicans controlled 60 of 99 legislative chambers. Thanks to the election, they will soon control at least 66. Majority status in two others remain undecided, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The only two Democratic \u201csuccesses\u201d of the night were holding onto majorities in the Iowa Senate and the Kentucky House. The GOP also picked up three gubernatorial seats.\n\nThis has bad implications for women, particularly on abortion rights. State legislatures were responsible for 200 new abortion restrictions between 2011-2013.\n\nAccording to the Guttmacher Institute, 42 states now prohibit abortions except when the woman\u2019s health is endangered after a certain point of pregnancy; 19 outlaw late-term \u201cpartial birth\u201d abortions; 32 prohibit state funds for abortion, with some exceptions; 26 require waiting periods, and so on; 17 require counseling before an abortion. Conservatives have required ever-increasing burdens that make it costly, time-consuming, and difficult to get an abortion. Texas is still in court battles to enact its restrictive abortion law that leaves only eight abortion providers open in a state with 5.4 million women who can get pregnant.\n\nOf course, Republicans in Washington also have designs on reproductive rights. House Republicans have passed bills that would ban abortions nationwide after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Harry Reid kept these items off the Senate\u2019s agenda, but Mitch McConnell, the new majority leader, has said he\u2019d bring them up.\n\nDemocrats tried to make these possibilities clear during the campaign, accusing Republicans of waging a \u201cwar on women.\u201d The polls suggest it didn\u2019t help the Democrats much. Iowa Republican Joni Ernst won her campaign, dismissing Democratic attacks with, \u201cI am a woman, and I have been to war and this is not a war.\u201d But neither Ernst nor other Republicans made much effort to debate specifics\u2014or to defend their positions. The argument that electing Republicans would be bad for women\u2019s rights may have proven ineffective this election year. That doesn\u2019t mean the description was wrong.", "topic": "Abortion", "politicalLabel": "Neutral", "organization": "New Republic", "biasLabel": "Biased", "title": "Republican Election Sweep Will Hurt Women's Health", "yellowLabel": "Yellow", "tags": "set(['Economics', 'qed', '2014 elections', '2014 midterms', 'Home News', 'The Plank', 'politics', 'Culture', 'Books', 'Identity', 'Politics', 'World', 'Technology', 'Events', 'Film', 'Economy'])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
