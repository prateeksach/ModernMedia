{"content": "Hundreds of Vermonters packed the Statehouse in Montpelier on Tuesday for a committee hearing on legislation that would expand background checks for gun buyers and impose other new firearms restrictions. Several opponents argued that the bill is not needed, pointing to Vermont\u2019s rank in F.B.I. statistics as the safest state. Supporters argued that Vermont is not immune from domestic violence and is not an island from the rest of the country.

It also would step up reporting to the federal background check system when a court adjudicates someone as mentally ill.", "topic": "Gun Control", "politicalLabel": "Neutral", "organization": "New York Times", "biasLabel": "Not Biased", "title": "Vermont: Hearing on Gun Law Draws Large Crowd at Statehouse", "yellowLabel": "Not Yellow", "tags": "set([])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
