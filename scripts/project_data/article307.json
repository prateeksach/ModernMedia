{"content": "When the abortion wars flared up last week, partisans of both sides rushed to the barricades \u2014 but the real lesson may be for the countless Americans in the middle.\n\nA private charity devoted to breast-cancer research, the Susan G. Komen Foundation for the Cure, announced it was cutting off some funding to Planned Parenthood \u2014 the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider, \u201cterminating\u201d some 300,000 pregnancies a year \u2014 and the roof fell in.\n\nHysterical feminists denounced what they called a politically motivated \u201cattack on women\u2019s health.\u201d Some 26 Senate Democrats snapped to, sending the foundation a letter urging it to reconsider. Mayor Bloomberg put up $250,000 of his own vast wealth as a matching grant, kicking off a fund-raising money bomb that saw Planned Parenthood\u2019s coffers swell by more than $3 million by the weekend.\n\nPro-lifers answered by sending Komen $1 million \u2014 but pro-choicers were also vowing to shut down the charity\u2019s donations. After a few days as Public Enemy No. 1, Komen caved.\n\n\u201cWe want to apologize to the American public for recent decisions that cast doubt upon our commitment to saving women\u2019s lives,\u201d it said in a groveling statement. \u201cWe will continue to fund existing grants, including those of Planned Parenthood.\u201d\n\nNever mind that Planned Parenthood doesn\u2019t actually offer mammograms, but only refers women to third-party providers. Never mind that, according to Komen\u2019s founder and CEO, Nancy Brinker, the foundation wanted to eliminate duplicative grants and free up funds for programs \u201cactually providing the lifesaving mammogram.\u201d\n\nAnd never mind that another reason Komen cut off funding had nothing to do with politics, but with a recently adopted in-house rule against funding organizations under government investigation.\n\nRep. Cliff Stearns (R-Fla.) is looking into allegations of overbilling and Medicaid fraud against Planned Parenthood, as well as charges that the organization has ignored state reporting requirements concerning evidence of sexual abuse. (The abortion provider gets nearly half a billion dollars a year from federal, state and local taxpayers.)\n\nTo the apocalyptic defenders of what they like to call \u201cwomen\u2019s health services,\u201d Komen\u2019s reasons just didn\u2019t matter. Nor did the fact that Komen, with its ubiquitous pink ribbons for breast-cancer awareness, has done far more for women\u2019s health than Planned Parenthood ever could.\n\nWhat matters is that even private charities can\u2019t be allowed to cast a shadow of doubt on the marquee protector of a woman\u2019s \u201cright to choose\u201d whether to abort her baby. Even a hint of deviation from the cause must be instantly and ruthlessly stamped out \u2014 by government intervention if necessary.\n\nThe same crowd, after all, had just finished cheering the Obama administration\u2019s mandate that private, religiously affiliated institutions must offer free birth-control as part of their health-care plans. Now they were thrilled to see more than a quarter of the Senate wade into what should have been a private decision.\n\nRegarding abortion, no dissent can be tolerated by the tolerance crowd, no threat, however faint, left unmet. Even though the money at stake \u2014 $600,000 \u2014 was relatively small, the symbol was too important.\n\nThirty-nine years and an estimated 50 million abortions after the Supreme Court created the unrestricted abortion right with its decision in Roe v. Wade, public support for the absolutist pro-choice side is falling.\n\nAt the very least, the money fountain might dry up. The House last year passed a bill banning any federal funding of abortion; it won\u2019t become law any time soon, but that doesn\u2019t mean appropriations can\u2019t be cut more quietly.\n\nIndeed, as Rep. Stearns pointed out, Planned Parenthood\u2019s windfall from the Komen flap calls into question why it should get any public monies at all. \u201cI believe that Planned Parenthood could be, and should be, totally self-sufficient, as with so many other nonprofit organizations,\u201d he said.\n\nNot funding abortion is a far cry from opposing or banning it, of course. But, as the Komen Foundation learned, the pro-choice lobby won\u2019t let anyone take that middle ground in peace.", "topic": "Abortion", "politicalLabel": "Neutral", "organization": "New York Post", "biasLabel": "Biased", "title": "Gutting the middle ground on abortion", "yellowLabel": "Not Yellow", "tags": "set(['Game of Thrones', 'Hillary Clinton', 'the masters', 'Chess', 'New York Yankees', 'NYPD'])", "opinionLabel": "Opinion Article"}
