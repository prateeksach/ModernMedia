{"content": "A family owned bakery has been ordered to make wedding cakes for gay couples and guarantee that its staff be given comprehensive training on Colorado\u2019s anti-discrimination laws after the state\u2019s Civil Rights Commission determined the Christian baker violated the law by refusing to bake a wedding cake for a same-sex couple.\n\nJack Phillips, the owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop, in Lakewood, Colorado was directed to change his store policies immediately and force his staff to attend the training sessions. For the next two years, Phillips will also be required to submit quarterly reports to the commission to confirm that he has not turned away customers based on their sexual orientation.\n\nADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThey are turning people of faith into religious refugees. ... Is this the society that we want to live in \u2013 where people of faith are driven out of business?\u201d - Nicolle Martin, attorney, Alliance Defending Freedom\n\nThink of it as reverse conversion therapy (or straight man\u2019s rehab) so that the state can mandate diversity through conformity.\n\nThe plight of Jack Phillips and his family is something I write about in my new book, \u201cGod Less America.\u201d His story of religious persecution is one of many that I document.\n\nNicolle Martin, an attorney with Alliance Defending Freedom, called the ruling Orwellian and said they are considering an appeal.\n\n\u201cThey are turning people of faith into religious refugees,\u201d Martin told me. \u201cIs this the society that we want to live in \u2013 where people of faith are driven out of business?\u201d\n\nMartin said it was \u201ctruly frightening\u201d that Phillips will be forced to submit quarterly reports to the government disclosing whether he turned away any wedding cake business.\n\n\u201cThere will be some reporting requirements so that Jack can demonstrate that he doesn\u2019t exercise his belief system anymore \u2013 that he has divested himself of his beliefs,\u201d she said.\n\nHe will also be required to create new policies and procedures for his staff.\n\n\u201cWe consider this reporting to be aimed at rehabilitating Jack so that he has the right thoughts,\u201d Martin said. \u201cThat\u2019s offensive to everything America stands for.\u201d\n\nPhillips, who is celebrating his 40th year in business this week, told me he\u2019s not going to create any new policies.\n\n\u201cMy old ones are pretty adequate as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t plan on giving up my faith and changing because of that.\u201d\n\nThe controversy started in 2012 when a gay couple asked Phillips to make their wedding cake. Phillips politely declined, saying he could not make a cake promoting a same-sex ceremony because of his faith. He offered to make them any other baked item they wanted.\n\nCharlie Craig and David Mullins filed a complaint with the Colorado Civil Rights Commission alleging they were discriminated against because of their sexual orientation. For the record, same-sex marriage is against the law in Colorado.\n\nThe commission affirmed a civil court\u2019s ruling that the bakery cannot discriminate against persons in a public place based on sexual orientation.\n\n\u201cYou can have your beliefs, but you can\u2019t hurt other people at the same time,\u201d Commission Chairwoman Katina Banks told The Denver Channel.\n\nACLU attorney Amanda Goad, who heads up the organization\u2019s LBGT group, heralded the ruling.\n\n\u201cReligious freedom is undoubtedly an important American value, but so is the right to be treated equally under the law free from discrimination,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nNo, my dear. Religious freedom is a CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT.\n\n\u201cEveryone is free to believe what they want, but businesses like Masterpiece Cakeshop cannot treat some customers differently than others based on who they are as people,\u201d Goad added.\n\nDavid Mullins, one of the two men who brought the lawsuit against Phillips, was thrilled with the ruling.\n\n\u201cWhat should have been a happy day for us turned into a humiliating and dehumanizing experience because of the way we were treated,\u201d he said in an ACLU statement.\n\nWho knew butter cream frosting could cause such angst?\n\n\u201cNo one should ever have to walk into a store and wonder if they will be turned away just because of who they are,\u201d Mullins added.\n\nBut that\u2019s not what Phillips did. He was more than willing to make them a cupcake.\n\n\u201cJack doesn\u2019t turn people away,\u201d Martin told me. \u201cThere are just some events that he won\u2019t lend his artistry to.\u201d\n\nThe ACLU accused Masterpiece Cakeshop of considering itself above the law.\n\n\u201cEveryone who shops in our stores and conducts business in our state should be treated with equality and dignity,\u201d attorney Paula Greisen said in an ACLU of Colorado statement. \u201cThat\u2019s what this ruling was about.\u201d\n\nNo ma\u2019am, it was not. That ruling was about bullying \u2013 bullying Christians.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a collision between religious liberty and the gay rights movement,\u201d Martin told me.\n\n\u201cThis collision is coming to the forefront almost every day. Somebody is losing their liberty, their job or both.\u201d\n\nBut thank goodness for someone like Jack Phillips, who refused to capitulate to the government\u2019s demands.\n\n\u201cMy God is bigger than any bullies they\u2019ve got,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t worry about it. I honor my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and be true to what He wants me to do.\u201d\n\nAnd the Civil Rights Commission is going to have a mighty hard time trying to \u201crehabilitate\u201d Phillips and his staff.\n\n\u201cMy 87-year-old mom works here and she says she\u2019s not being rehabilitated,\u201d he said.\n\nMartin said the Alliance Defending Freedom will \u201ccontinue to stand with Jack against overreach and tyranny by the state.\u201d\n\n\u201cJack has gone out on a limb and taken this stand \u2013 and not capitulated to the government\u2019s demands,\u201d she said. \u201cThat speaks volumes about him.\u201d\n\nAnd should the highest court in the land force Jack to do the bidding of homosexuals?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s civil disobedience,\u201d Phillips told me. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens. I\u2019m not giving up my faith. Too many people have died for this faith to give it up that easily.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the bullying tactics of the militant gay rights community have not hampered the bakery\u2019s bottom line. They\u2019ve gotten so much business from the sales of cookies and brownies, they\u2019ve temporarily stopped making wedding cakes.\n\n\u201cObey Christ rather than worry about what man can do to you,\u201d Phillips said.\n\nThere you have it, folks. In Colorado, you can\u2019t have your cake and religious beliefs, too.\n\nTodd Starnes is host of Fox News & Commentary, heard on hundreds of radio stations.
