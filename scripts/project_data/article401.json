{"content": "With every aspect of the abortion issue controversial these days, why wouldn\u2019t the labels be as well? Apparently some abortion rights advocates are retiring the term \u201cpro-choice\u201d to describe what they do. \u201cI just think the \u2018pro-choice\u2019 language doesn\u2019t really resonate, particularly with a lot of young women voters,\u201d Cecile Richards, the president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said in a New York Times article Tuesday.\n\nA woman's main concern on a day-to-day basis may not be abortion rights. But she has the luxury of abortion rights not being a main concern because it's been legal for 40 years. -\n\nIncreasingly, I hear (and use in print) the term \u201creproductive health\u201d rights or issues to describe controversies over abortion access and contraception. I\u2019ve never been particularly fond of the \u2018pro-choice\u2019 and \u2018pro-life\u2019 handles. The latter I find verging on offensive. People can\u2019t support abortion rights but also protect life by advocating against the death penalty and for human rights, better conditions in prisons, better healthcare? I prefer to call people abortion rights advocates or activists and abortion rights opponents or antiabortion activists. (So does the news side of the Los Angeles Times.) Those terms are specific and not emotionally loaded. And I think we should identify exactly what people\u2019s causes are.\n\nWhat\u2019s troubling is hearing that young women don\u2019t get \u201cpro-choice.\u201d This is similar to my problem with young women proclaiming that they are not feminists. (But don\u2019t get me started. That\u2019s another blog post for another day.)\n\nWhat women \u2014 apparently young women in particular \u2014 need to be cognizant of is that many of their rights to control their reproductive systems are under attack by antiabortion activists. Most women are familiar with \u2014 and probably worried about \u2014 the various (successful) attacks on the portion of the Affordable Care Act that mandates employers\u2019 insurance plans cover contraception. But in addition, state legislatures across the country have passed laws eroding access to a woman\u2019s constitutional right to a legal abortion. There are, variously, waiting periods before a woman can have an abortion, requirements that no abortion be performed after a fetal heartbeat is detected (which cuts back the window of time that Roe vs. Wade authorized for a legal abortion), and requirements that abortion providers have hospital admitting privileges. That last one requires something unnecessary from a doctor performing abortions. And in Texas, where it has become law, it has had the effect of closing a number of clinics where abortions were provided.\n\nPeople can call the movement to protect a woman\u2019s constitutional right to oversee her own body anything they want: pro-choice, pro-women\u2019s health, pro-abortion rights or some other catchall phrase. But people who prefer a more all-encompassing term like women\u2019s health care should not delude themselves into believing that the only thing on the conservative agenda is taking away their right to subsidized contraception. Yes, that\u2019s part of it. And it\u2019s not right. But crippling access to abortion takes away the right to decide if you are giving birth to a child or not. And that\u2019s a profoundly important, constitutionally guaranteed right that women \u2014 and men \u2014 should not take for granted.\n\nOf course, women have numerous health and economic concerns. We all do. They should all be advocated for. My only worry is that fuzzing up the titles is a way for women\u2019s abortion rights advocates and reproductive rights advocates to attract supporters who say their main issue is not abortion rights \u2014 or that they\u2019re not concerned at all about abortion rights. Sure, a woman\u2019s main concern on a day-to-day basis may not be abortion rights. Her main concern may be basic healthcare for herself and her kids, or something else.\n\nBut she has the luxury of abortion rights not being her main concern because it\u2019s been an absolute guaranteed right in this country for 40 years. That means every woman in this country under the age of 40 never had to worry about getting an illegal, unsafe abortion. And for those in their 20s and early 30s, chances are their mothers never had to worry about it either. That\u2019s a long time to get lulled into a sense of security that that right is never going away \u2014 and therefore we don\u2019t need to make its protection a priority. What pro-choice or abortion rights advocates work hard at is making sure that that right doesn\u2019t go away.\n\nSo the advocates can say they\u2019re not calling themselves pro-choice and the young women they poll can say they don\u2019t like calling themselves pro-choice. But no one should think for a second that the advocacy to protect abortion rights is no longer a priority.\n\nFollow the Opinion section on Twitter @latimesopinion", "topic": "Abortion", "politicalLabel": "Neutral", "organization": "LA Times", "biasLabel": "Biased", "title": "Call yourself 'pro-choice' or not, your abortion rights are under attack", "yellowLabel": "Not Yellow", "tags": "set(['Family Planning', 'Social Issues', 'Civil and Human Rights', 'Planned Parenthood', 'Laws and Legislation'])", "opinionLabel": "Opinion Article"}
