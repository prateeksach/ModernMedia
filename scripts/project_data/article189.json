Burwell. They will consider whether to take health care away from millions of Americans. They will consider whether to cast much of the health care sector into chaos, potentially destabilizing the individual insurance market in many states. They will consider whether to undercut a program that provides health care to children, potentially leaving 5 million of these children uninsured. And they will consider whether thousands of wives get to hold their husbands again and whether thousands of fathers get to kiss their daughters again. By one estimate, nearly 10,000 Americans will die every year if the justices vote against Obamacare in King.\n\nKing, in the words of the New York Times\u2018 Linda Greenhouse, enlists the Supreme Court \u201cinto the front lines of a partisan war.\u201d It rests on the notion that six words of a nearly 1,000 page law can be read out of context to destroy one of the law\u2019s central functions. And, yet, the King plaintiffs could prevail. The biggest predictor of how a judge will vote in an Obamacare case has been the judge\u2019s political party, and five of the nine justices are Republicans.\n\nBased on our analysis of the law, the justices\u2019 past statements, and their ability to resist partisan pressure in the past, here is a breakdown of how each justice is likely to vote, ranked from the most likely to uphold the law to the most likely to take health care away from millions:\n\nJustices Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor and Kagan\n\nCREDIT: AP Photo/Charles Dharapak, Pool\n\nAs recently as last week, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg penned an opinion joined by Chief Justice John Roberts plus all of her fellow liberal justices except for one, which rejected the idea that a few words of a law may be read out of context by judges attempting to divine those words\u2019 meaning. \u201cWhether a statutory term is unambiguous,\u201d Ginsburg wrote, \u201cdoes not turn solely on dictionary definitions of its component words.\u201d Rather, a court must look to \u201cthe specific context in which that language is used, and the broader context of the statute as a whole.\u2019\u201d Though Justice Elena Kagan was the sole Democratic appointee not to join Ginsburg\u2019s opinion, she nevertheless snuck a pointed statement into her dissent that rejects the King plaintiffs\u2019 acontextual method of reading the law. \u201cI agree with the plurality (really, who does not?) that context matters in interpreting statutes,\u201d Kagan wrote, adding that \u201c[w]e do not \u2018construe the meaning of statutory terms in a vacuum.\u2019 Rather, we interpret particular words \u2018in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt would simply be extraordinary if the Court\u2019s Democrats, two of whom were appointed by President Obama, voted to gut Obamacare based on the proposition that the words of a law can be read outside of their context. There is an off chance, however, that one or more of the Court\u2019s more liberal members could embrace the plaintiffs\u2019 reading of Obamacare if that helps them build a majority around a different legal theory that will also save the law.\n\nThe plaintiffs argue that states that set up their own health exchange where individuals can buy subsidized health insurance \u2014 rather than permitting the federal government to do so for them \u2014 are the only states where residents may receive their share of hundreds of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of tax credits enabling them to afford insurance. Even if the plaintiffs are correct that the law should be read this way, however, several amicus briefs make a strong argument that imposing such a condition upon the states violates states rights and would therefore be unconstitutional.\n\nIn NFIB v. Sebelius, the last lawsuit seeking to destroy Obamacare, Justices Stephen Breyer and Kagan joined the Court\u2019s Republicans in making the law\u2019s Medicaid expansion optional. Though those of us who were not a party to the Court\u2019s private communications can only speculate as to whether Breyer and Kagan did so out of a sincere belief or because they agreed to lend their name to this controversial decision in order to help convince Chief Justice John Roberts to save the remainder of the law, it is worth noting that Kagan, in particular, seemed very unlikely to label the original Medicaid expansion unconstitutional during oral arguments. So, while it is unlikely that any of the Court\u2019s Democrats will actually vote to strike down a major part of Obamacare in King, it is possible that one or more of them will throw a bone to conservatives if that helps convince one of the Court\u2019s Republicans to save the law.\n\nOdds the Democratic appointees \u2014 Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor and Kagan \u2014 will vote to uphold Obamacare: over 99 percent.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts\n\nCREDIT: AP Photo\n\nRoberts proved fickle in the first Supreme Court case seeking to kill the Affordable Care Act. Although Roberts initially voted to strike down the law\u2019s individual mandate, he later flipped his vote to uphold the bulk of the law, breaking with his fellow Republicans in the process. CBS News\u2019s Jan Crawford, a veteran Supreme Court reporter who is well-connected on the Republican side of the Court, later suggested that Roberts may have flipped his vote because he is \u201csensitive to how the court is perceived by the public.\u201d Though Crawford caveats her reporting by noting that \u201c[i]t is not known why Roberts changed his view on the mandate and decided to uphold the law,\u201d she notes that \u201ccountless news articles in May warning of damage to the court\u201d may have influenced the chief justice\u2019s thinking.\n\nShould Roberts turn around and gut Obamacare in King, he would only confirm many people\u2019s fears that the Supreme Court has become the judicial wing of the Republican Party. As the Washington Post\u2018s Robert Barnes wrote on Friday, King presents Roberts with a dilemma: \u201cCan Roberts\u2019s portrayal of the Supreme Court as above politics survive another round with the most partisan issue of the decade?\u201d\n\nGiven the weak legal arguments advanced by the plaintiffs, and the minimal likelihood that any of the Court\u2019s Democrats would join a decision gutting the law, numerous commentators have concluded that the answer to this question is \u201cno\u201d if the justices decide to strike down the tax credits. As Washington & Lee law professor Tim Jost said in a Center for American Progress-produced video, \u201ca 5-to-4 decision invalidating the premium tax credits would seriously call into question the legitimacy of the Court.\u201d He added that such a decision would \u201cpretty transparently\u201d happen \u201cfor political reasons.\u201d\n\nCompeting against Roberts\u2019 desire to preserve the legitimacy of his Court is the fact that he remains a conservative Republican, and he\u2019s hardly been shy about advancing a very conservative agenda in areas such as voting rights and campaign finance. The chief\u2019s conservative instincts were on full display in his initial vote on Obamacare three years ago. He overcame those instincts that time, but it is far from clear that he will be able to do so again.\n\nOdds Chief Justice Roberts votes to uphold Obamacare: 50 percent.\n\nJustice Anthony Kennedy\n\nCREDIT: AP Photo\n\nIn describing Kennedy\u2019s reaction to Roberts\u2019 vote in NFIB, one source told Jan Crawford that Kennedy was \u201crelentless\u201d in trying to bring Roberts back in line with his fellow Republicans. Four of the Court\u2019s Republicans signed a dissent calling for the entirety of the Affordable Care Act to be repealed, and Kennedy read that opinion from the bench on the same day that Roberts read the majority opinion saving most of the law (reading a dissent from the bench is one method that members of the Court use to convey extraordinary displeasure with a decision). Given Kennedy\u2019s anger that the Court did not repeal the law three years ago, he is now an unlikely vote in its favor.\n\nThat said, there are two mitigating factors that could sway Justice Kennedy. The first is the argument that the King plaintiffs\u2019 reading of the law violates states rights. Kennedy is a strong advocate for federalism; he believes that states\u2019 rights \u201cprotect[] the liberty of the individual from arbitrary power.\u201d If he can set aside his disdain for Obamacare in King, he could potentially score a major victory for a cause that he has long championed.\n\nThe other factor is that Kennedy has, at times, been willing to break from the Court\u2019s conservatives when he believes that the welfare of children is at stake. As an amicus brief explains, the King plaintiffs\u2019 argument does not simply threaten people insured through the exchanges, it also threatens the health care of as many as 5 million children insured through the CHIP program. That risk to children\u2019s health may give Kennedy pause.\n\nNevertheless, Kennedy remains an unlikely vote to uphold the law in this case. His previous actions in NFIB are likely to be repeated.\n\nOdds Justice Kennedy votes to uphold Obamacare: 15 percent.\n\nJustice Antonin Scalia\n\nCREDIT: AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis\n\nIf this were an ordinary case, Scalia\u2019s vote to uphold the tax credits would be all but certain. Just five months before the Court agreed to hear King, Justice Scalia wrote in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA about \u201cthe fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.\u201d A book that Scalia co-authored in 2012 explains that \u201cno interpretive fault is more common than the failure to follow the whole-text canon, which calls on the judicial interpreter to consider the entire text, in view of its structure and of the physical and logical relation of its many parts.\u201d For Scalia to look at Obamacare and conclude that six words may be read out of context from the law as a whole would be an extraordinary departure from the conservative justice\u2019s previously stated views.\n\nNevertheless, we\u2019ve seen this movie before. Scalia\u2019s own opinion in Gonzales v. Raich provided a road map for a decision upholding the Affordable Care Act in NFIB, but Scalia decided not to follow it. He voted instead to repeal the entire law.\n\nIt is possible that Scalia will feel more of a compulsion in King than he did in NFIB to follow his own previous decisions. But we wouldn\u2019t bet on it.\n\nOdds Justice Scalia votes to uphold Obamacare: less than 10 percent.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas\n\nCREDIT: AP Photo/Dr. Scott M. Lieberman\n\nLike Scalia, Thomas has also expressed the view that the words of a law must not be read out of context. Rather, according to Thomas, courts should look to \u201cthe language itself, the specific context in which that language is used, and the broader context of the statute as a whole.\u201d Thomas, however, is well to Scalia\u2019s right on many issues, and he has not gone as far out on a limb as Scalia has by authoring a book that is incompatible with the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments in King. It is not impossible that Thomas would vote to uphold the tax credits, but it is exceedingly unlikely.\n\nOdd Justice Thomas votes to uphold Obamacare: less than 5 percent.\n\nCREDIT: AP Photo/Charles Dharapak\n\nJustice Samuel Alito\n\nJustice Alito is the most partisan member of the Court\u2019s conservative bloc. Among other things, he is the only one of the Court\u2019s Republicans who has never broken with the four other Republican members of the Court to vote with its four Democrats. He frequently uses his questions during oral arguments to bore holes in the position supported by liberals. Alito is the last justice who will cross over to uphold part of President Obama\u2019s chief legislative accomplishment.\n\nOdds Justice Alito votes to uphold Obamacare: he is more likely to be struck by lightning while committing in-person voter fraud.", "topic": "Obamacare", "politicalLabel": "Liberal", "organization": "ThinkProgress", "biasLabel": "Biased", "title": "The Odds That Each Justice Will Vote To Destroy Obamacare", "yellowLabel": "Yellow", "tags": "set(['NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION', 'Obamacare', 'IMMIGRATION', 'POLICE BRUTALITY', 'Supreme Court', 'CRIMINAL JUSTICE', 'CALIFORNIA'])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
