{"content": "Bitterly admitting defeat, the Republican-controlled Congress sent legislation to President Barack Obama on Tuesday that funds the Department of Homeland Security without any of the immigration-related concessions they demanded for months.\n\n\u201cSanity is prevailing,\u201d said Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., a former chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, before the House voted 257-167 in favor of the $40 billion spending bill, which Obama was expected to sign promptly.\n\nAll 182 Democrats present voted for the bill, while it received only 75 Republican \u201cyes\u201d votes.\n\nThe outcome averted a partial agency shutdown which would have begun Friday at midnight. It was a major victory for Obama and the Democrats, and a wholesale retreat for Republicans, who have spent months railing against an \u201cunconstitutional overreach\u201d by Obama in extending deportation stays and work permits to millions of immigrants in this country illegally.\n\nIn the end Republicans who\u2019d tried to use the DHS spending bill to undo Obama\u2019s actions had little to show but weeks of gridlock and chaotic spectacle on Capitol Hill in the wake of assuming full control of Congress in the November midterm elections. The turmoil brought the Homeland Security Department to within hours of a partial shutdown last Friday before Congress passed a one-week extension, and raised questions about Republicans\u2019 ability to govern responsibly.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, addressing an uncharacteristically subdued gathering of House Republicans, Speaker John Boehner indicated he was out of options.\n\n\u201cI am as outraged and frustrated as you at the lawless and unconstitutional actions of this president,\u201d Boehner told his caucus. \u201cI believe this decision \u2013 considering where we are \u2013 is the right one for this team, and the right one for this country.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur Republican colleagues in the Senate never found a way to win this fight,\u201d he said, noting that the matter is now in the courts. A federal judge last month put Obama\u2019s directives on hold, a ruling the White House is appealing.\n\nConservative lawmakers who humiliated Boehner last week by voting down a three-week spending bill he proposed did not speak up in the private meeting to dissent or ask questions, people present said.\n\nAfterward, they said they were disappointed but had no more moves to make.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that there is one,\u201d said Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa. \u201cThis is the signal of capitulation.\u201d\n\nThe measure passed Tuesday funds the Homeland Security Department through the Sept. 30 end of the budget year. It pays for numerous priorities including Transportation Security agents, the Coast Guard, the Secret Service, a host of immigration-related functions and grants to local governments.\n\nThere have been suggestions that Boehner would face an insurrection by tea party-backed conservatives if he brought a \u201cclean\u201d DHS bill to the floor. But Boehner\u2019s opponents seemed resigned, and there was little sign of a brewing coup.\n\nIndeed, several Republicans said Tuesday that the outcome was inevitable. Many had campaigned for re-election last fall on promises to stop Obama on immigration, and cheered when Boehner promised to fight the president\u2019s moves \u201ctooth and nail.\u201d Yet several acknowledged they never had a viable plan to do so, given Obama\u2019s veto pen and Senate Democrats\u2019 opposition.\n\nThe GOP strategy was especially risky given the Homeland Security Department\u2019s anti-terrorism responsibilities, which gave Democrats an opening to accuse Republicans of putting national security at risk.\n\n\u201cWe all knew how this was going to end,\u201d said Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa. \u201cIf somebody wants to make an argument against those of us who are doing our duty and governing responsibly, they can feel free to have the argument. We are prepared to defend ourselves and I believe the Speaker will come out of this just fine.\u201d\n\nThe drama unfolded as a lesson in the limits of divided government.\n\nThe fight was set up last fall, when Boehner and GOP leaders convinced House conservatives to wait until this year to try to overturn Obama on immigration, when the GOP would command control of the Senate and bigger majorities in the House.\n\nCongress passed a full-year spending bill for the rest of the government, but kept the Homeland Security Department on a short leash to use its spending bill as the vehicle to oppose Obama.\n\nRepublicans predicted that the handful of Senate Democrats who\u2019d voiced concerns about Obama\u2019s immigration actions would join them. But the DHS spending bill the House passed in January was yanked to the right by conservatives, undoing not only Obama\u2019s most recent executive actions but an earlier directive, from 2012, that extended protections to immigrants brought illegally to the country as kids.\n\nThat helped unify Democrats against it, and Senate rules did the rest. Republicans command only 54 votes in the chamber, not the 60 needed to advance most legislation, and Senate Democrats blocked the House bill repeatedly.\n\nIn the end, the House contingent that opposed Boehner had little to do but bemoan what had become a foregone conclusion. As the drama neared its conclusion Tuesday they offered a few final procedural moves \u2013 forcing the reading clerk to read part of the bill out loud, and offering a motion to table \u2013 but they had no hope of prevailing.\n\n\u201cI believe this is a sad day for America,\u201d said Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., one of the hardliners. \u201cIf we\u2019re not going to fight now, when are we going to fight?\u201d", "topic": "Immigration", "politicalLabel": "Liberal", "organization": "New York Post", "biasLabel": "Biased", "title": "Congress passes DHS spending bill without immigration riders", "yellowLabel": "Not Yellow", "tags": "set(['Obama administration', 'Department of Homeland Security', 'Immigration', 'Congress'])", "opinionLabel": "Other"}
