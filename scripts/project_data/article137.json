{"content": "\u201cI\u2019m sorry sir,\u201d the polite Healthcare.gov customer-service agent said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do. You\u2019re either going to have to enroll in Medicaid or you\u2019re going to have to pay the full health-insurance rate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe rate you quoted earlier?\u201d I asked. \u201cThat\u2019s nearly 30 percent higher than my current insurance bill, I just can\u2019t afford it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to pay the full rate, yes,\u201d the agent replied.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d I explained. \u201cI have plenty of money to pay you a reasonable rate, but I can\u2019t afford to pay the same rate a millionaire would be asked to pay. Why can\u2019t I just receive a partial subsidy? I\u2019m willing to pay more than what Medicaid offers.\u201d\n\n\u201cSir, that\u2019s just not how the system works.\u201d\n\nRight. That\u2019s not how ObamaCare works; it doesn\u2019t work at all.\n\nI was 26 when my graduate school informed me in 2013 that thanks to \u201cusage rates of the plan, changing health-insurance regulations, and the administrative workload that is involved in managing a plan\u201d after the passage of the Affordable Care Act, students could no longer buy health coverage through the school.\n\nSo much for President Obama\u2019s promises of \u201cif you like your plan, you can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan.\u201d\n\nI had health insurance. I liked it. But that plan disappeared.\n\nAnd college officials confirmed my suspicion that ObamaCare was the culprit. \u201cIt\u2019s just too expensive to operate under the new health-care regulations,\u201d I was told.\n\nSo there I was: A struggling grad student with no health insurance, and unable to afford unsubsidized ObamaCare plans I\u2019d hardly, if ever, use.\n\nBut Uncle Sam was there on his white horse, ready to save my day with . . . Medicaid?\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with getting government help in a time of need, but I wasn\u2019t in a time of need. I had some money from student loans, and no serious health concerns; my career was getting started and my wife was less than two years from graduating medical school.\n\nCall me crazy, but in my book Medicaid is a last resort, not a first option.\n\nFaced with the choice of either violating a strong conviction by going on Medicaid or signing up for ObamaCare insurance I couldn\u2019t afford, I chose a third option: short-term insurance.\n\nUnlike traditional health plans, short-term plans are generally available only to healthy buyers and last for a set period.\n\nAfter that period ends, the insurer can choose not to renew, and often won\u2019t if you\u2019ve developed a serious or costly illness such as cancer.\n\nThat got me through 2014; for this year, I\u2019ve signed up for an ObamaCare plan that costs roughly 30 percent more than that plan, though it has a similar deductible and coverage. I\u2019m not happy about the increase in cost, but I\u2019m more than willing to pay into the system now that I can afford it.\n\nWhat is incredibly frustrating, however, is that I now have to pay ObamaCare\u2019s tax (or is it a fine?) for last year, because my short-term plan (like most) doesn\u2019t count as buying \u201cadequate insurance\u201d under ObamaCare\u2019s mandates.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter that my short-term plan was comparable to other \u201ccatastrophic\u201d plans offered on the federal exchange. The ObamaCare law prohibits the overwhelming majority of short-term plans from qualifying as \u201cquality\u201d coverage.\n\nThe reason is obvious. If young, healthy people \u2014 the group that the American Enterprise Institute\u2019s Scott Gottlieb and Kelly Funderburk say is being \u201cripped off\u201d by ObamaCare rates \u2014 opt out of the ObamaCare exchanges, the exchanges will collapse in a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d because not enough healthy folks will be paying in to make up for the less-healthy ones, who need more care.\n\nMy experience perfectly highlights the insanity of the Affordable Care Act. It forced me \u2014 a paying, insured, well-educated, healthy American \u2014 out of the coverage I\u2019d had, then tried to push me into Medicaid.\n\nThe program wouldn\u2019t let me pay more when I offered to pay a higher rate to stay out of Medicaid, and it provided only one other option: paying the highest rate available for insurance I didn\u2019t use once in 2014.\n\nRather than take the easy route and enroll in Medicaid, I paid my own way with a private plan of my choosing. Now, instead of being rewarded for saving taxpayer money, I\u2019m being punished with a fine of at least $95.
